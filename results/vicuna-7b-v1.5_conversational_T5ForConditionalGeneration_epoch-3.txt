It seems like you have shared a code snippet that is using a library called "react-google-maps" to display a Google Map on a web page.

Here is a brief explanation of what the code is doing:

* The code starts by importing the necessary modules and components from the "react-google-maps" library.
* It then defines a state variable called "center" that will hold the center coordinates of the map.
* The code then renders a div element with a class of "map" and a Google Map inside it. The map is centered on the coordinates stored in the "center" state variable.
* The code also renders a button element with a class of "btn" and an "onClick" event handler that calls a function called "setCenter" when clicked. This function updates the "center" state variable with new coordinates.
* Finally, the code renders a div element with a class of "controls" that displays the map controls (e.g. zoom in/out, pan, etc.).

Overall, this code is setting up a basic Google Map on a web page using the "react-google-maps" library.
