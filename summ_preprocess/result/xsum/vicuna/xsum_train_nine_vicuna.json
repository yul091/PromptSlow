        "output": "The damage caused by flooding in Newton Stewart, Hawick, and Peeblesshire is still being assessed. Repair work is ongoing in Hawick, and many roads in Peeblesshire remain badly affected by standing water. Trains on the west coast mainline face disruption due to damage at the Lamington Viaduct. Many businesses and householders in Newton Stewart were affected by flooding after the River Cree overflowed into the town. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon visited the area to inspect the damage. The waters breached a retaining wall, flooding many commercial properties on Victoria Street, the main shopping thoroughfare. Jeanette Tate, who owns the Cinnamon Cafe, said she could not fault the multi-agency response once the flood hit. However, she said more preventative work could have been carried out to ensure the retaining wall did not fail. She also expressed concerns about the lack of support from the authorities. Meanwhile, a flood alert remains in place across the Borders because of the constant rain. Peebles was badly hit by problems, sparking calls to introduce more defences in the area. Scottish Borders Council has put a list on its website of the roads worst affected, and drivers have been urged not to ignore closure signs. Scottish Borders Labour Party's deputy leader Alex Rowley was in Hawick on Monday to see the situation first-hand. He said it was important to get the flood protection plan right but backed calls to speed up the process. He said it was important that \"immediate steps\" were taken to protect the areas most vulnerable and a clear timetable put in place for flood prevention plans. The public is encouraged to share their experiences of the situation and the government's response.",

We will try to give them a hard time.\"\nVandoorne's preparations for his grand prix debut were far from ideal - he only found out he was racing on Thursday when FIA doctors declared Fernando Alonso unfit because of a broken rib sustained in his huge crash at the first race of the season in Australia two weeks ago.\nThe Belgian rookie had to fly overnight from Japan, where he had been testing in the Super Formula car he races there, and arrived in Bahrain only hours before first practice on Friday.\nHe also had a difficult final practice, missing all but the final quarter of the session because of a water leak.\nButton was quicker in the first qualifying session, but Vandoorne pipped him by 0.064secs when it mattered.\nThe 24-year-old said: \"I knew after yesterday I had quite similar pace to Jenson and I knew if I improved a little bit I could maybe challenge him and even out-qualify him and that is what has happened.\n\"Jenson is a very good benchmark for me because he is a world champion and he is well known to the team so I am very satisfied with the qualifying.\"\nButton, who was 0.5secs quicker than Vandoorne in the first session, complained of oversteer on his final run in the second: \"Q1 was what I was expecting.

There were three minutes at the end of the first session with no cars on the circuit, and the end of the second session was a similar damp squib.\nOnly one car - Nico Hulkenberg's Force India - was out on the track with six minutes to go.

But it's all over the place.\"\nSo why did all these different species acquire the same colour?\nGiven their relatively simple eyes, it is doubtful that tarantulas can distinguish this shade of blue from any other colour.\nThat is one of the reasons that sexual selection seems unlikely - by contrast with some other spiders, which have remarkably good vision and put on very colourful courtship displays, such as the mesmerising peacock spider.\n\"It evolved from multiple origins and different mechanisms produce the very same blue colour,\" Mr Hsiung said. \"That's very strong evidence to suggest that this blue colour has a very important visual signalling function.\n\"But if it's not for other tarantulas, then it must be to some other receivers out there.\"\nIt may be that this colour helps conceal the critters from their prey while they hunt at night; or perhaps it serves as a warning to stop the tarantulas themselves being eaten.\n\"We don't know yet,\" Mr Hsiung said.\nFollow Jonathan on Twitter",
        "output": "A study by US biologists has found that the blue color of tarantulas is created by tiny structures inside their hairs, but the shapes of these structures vary across different species. This suggests that the blue color is not driven by sexual selection, as is often the case in other animals. The researchers analyzed data from previously published studies and constructed a super-tree to map the blueness of tarantulas onto their evolutionary tree. They then calculated the number of changes required to produce the distribution of blue coloring observed in these species. The team used electron microscopes to examine the blue hairs of eight tarantula species and found that multiple independent mechanisms can produce the same shade of blue. It is unlikely that tarantulas can distinguish this shade of blue from any other color, which suggests that the blue color may have a important visual signaling function.

He said they would be analysed in a laboratory but were \"heavily damaged\".\nAlso on Thursday, Germanwings said it was unaware that Lubitz had experienced depression while he was training to be a pilot.\nLufthansa confirmed on Tuesday that it knew six years ago that the co-pilot had suffered from an episode of \"severe depression'' before he finished his flight training.\n``We didn't know this,'' said Vanessa Torres, a spokeswoman for Lufthansa subsidiary Germanwings, which hired Lubitz in September 2013.\nShe could not explain why Germanwings had not been informed.\nThe final minutes\nLubitz began the jet's descent at 10:31 (09:31 GMT) on 24 March, shortly after the A320 had made its final contact with air traffic control.\nLittle more than eight minutes later, it had crashed into a mountain near Seyne-les-Alpes.\nWhat happened in the last 30 minutes of Flight 4U 9525?\nWho was Andreas Lubitz?",

He is currently not hosting the show.\nGiving evidence on Wednesday, Mr Fox said he had worked with \"hundreds\" of female colleagues during his career, but had never been accused of sexually inappropriate behaviour until last year.\nUnder questioning from his defence counsel, Jonathan Caplan QC, he told the court his teams had kept their energy up during live broadcasts by playing loud music, dancing and creating makeshift obstacle courses.\n\"It sounds daft, but it was the way we, I, got myself going, and the team would join in very much as well. They would be part of that.\"\nHe said his entire shifts, not just the on-air periods, constituted a \"full performance\" and colleagues would often make playful comments to one another.\nMr Caplan asked: \"Could those comments become edgy or sexual?\"\nMr Fox replied: \"Of course they could. Like any office. Some of it could be saucy, cheeky, over-the-top.\"\nReferring to the \"horseplay\" in the office, Mr Fox insisted he would never have engaged in such conduct if it was not consensual, \"otherwise it would create a bad atmosphere in the studio\".\nAsked whether the culture of radio had changed during the past 25 years, he said: \"I think the workplace in general, it's changed, hasn't it?\n\"Laws have changed. HR has changed. Political correctness has changed.\"\nHe added: \"But I don't think my behaviour has changed. I'm the same guy now, with the same morals, as I was then.\"\nOne former colleague has accused the DJ of squeezing her breasts from behind. Asked about that, he said: \"That would be wholly wrong, totally disrespectful, and it's not something I would do.\"\nThe complainant, who cannot be named for legal reasons, has also said Mr Fox once pushed her over and simulated having sex with her.\nAddressing that allegation, he said people in his then-workplace often pretended to have been caught in compromising positions - it was a \"play-acting high jinks thing\", he said.\nMr Fox told the court he had seen it \"many times\", but agreed that out of context, the \"Benny Hill-style\" comedy could have seemed inappropriate.\nProsecutor John Price QC said: \"She says that when you did that to her, she did not consent to it. Are you in a position to dispute that?\"\nMr Fox replied: \"I can't get in (her) head.\"\nMr Price continued: \"Did you ask her before you did it if it was okay?\" to which the defendant replied: \"No.\"\nMr Fox also denied having sexual contact with a 15-year-old fan, including during a private tour of Capital Radio's record library.\n\"It never happened,\" he said, although he did acknowledge he \"could have easily taken her for a tour\".\nMr Fox agreed it would be \"quite wrong\" for an adult man to \"stick his tongue\" into the mouth of a teenage girl, as the woman alleged he had done in the station's car park on another occasion.\nIf a young fan asked him for a kiss, he would respond with \"a social kiss\" on the cheek, he said.\nThe girl in question had, he added, \"become a little bit obsessed with me\".\nAsked why three unrelated individuals were accusing him of similar inappropriate conduct, Mr Fox replied: \"I don't have an explanation at all.\"\nMr Price said: \"Coincidence is ridiculous, isn't it, as an explanation for these things?\"\nThe DJ replied: \"I can't explain those coincidences.\"\nThe trial continues.",

She had been raped by the same man.\nWhen she reported the crime to elders, Wendy was made to describe it in minute detail to a group of older men.\nLater, she had to give her account again in the same room as Sewell.\nAfterwards, the elders told her that as it was only her account against that of Sewell, nothing more could be done.\nThis bringing together of the accused and the accuser in a \"judicial committee\" is a common feature of Jehovah's Witnesses' justice.\nKaren, still a teenager at the time, was put through the process.\nThe elders also ruled that their separate accusations didn't constitute the required two witnesses.\nDespite a pattern of predatory sexual behaviour, it took more than two decades to bring Wendy and Karen's abuser to justice.\nHe is now serving a 14-year prison sentence.\nHis punishment from the Jehovah's Witnesses? There wasn't one.\nEven when the case came to court, the organisation was reluctant to co-operate.\nKaren's father, John Viney, who was also an elder in the Barry congregation, says that elders who knew of Sewell's conduct and were asked to give statements or evidence in court did not want to get involved.\nIn a programme for Radio 4's The Report, we have identified this lack of co-operation in several other similar cases.\nConfidential documents from the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society of Britain - the official name for the Jehovah's Witnesses - that we have seen are explicit about the best way to deal with such matters being within the congregation.\nNowhere in the hundreds of pages we have seen are elders told that they must go to the police, even if the perpetrator confesses, unless state or national law makes it mandatory to report such allegations.\nThe Jehovah's Witnesses' UK leadership declined to talk to us for the programme.\nIn a statement, they said they were appealing against a recent High Court ruling in the UK that awarded substantial damages against the organisation for failing to protect a child from sexual abuse by a paedophile.\nTheir statement also insists that the organisation does take child abuse extremely seriously.\nKaren Morgan and Wendy are now pursuing a civil claim against the organisation, hoping that further financial penalty may force the leadership of the Jehovah's Witnesses to change its policies.\nFor both of them, what made it even harder was the sense that belonging to the Jehovah's Witnesses was part of an all-encompassing lifestyle, with members encouraged to socialise and marry within the group.\nThe organisation has some eight million members around the world, but as Karen found to her cost, those who decide to have a boyfriend or girlfriend who is not a member may find themselves \"disfellowshipped\" or shunned.\nJehovah's Witnesses are not the only religious organisation to try to deal with allegations of sexual abuse in-house.\nFor many decades, that was the preferred method of the Roman Catholic Church, which has since reformed its child safeguarding policies following numerous court cases in the US and Europe against priests for the sexual abuse of children.\nOther churches have also tightened up their child safeguarding policies, with the Methodist Church conducting its own recent inquiry into abuse allegations dating back to 1950.\nThat inquiry has led to calls for the Church of England to hold a fresh internal inquiry of its own, separately from the overarching national public inquiry that has just begun, and from the investigation it published in 2010, which critics termed inadequate.\nHowever, it is the more closed religious communities and new religious movements where it remains hardest for the victims of such abuse to speak out and gain access to secular justice, although awareness of the issue is growing.\nOnly this month, an ultra-Orthodox Jewish scholar from Manchester - who fled to Israel after he was exposed as a paedophile - was jailed for 13 years.\nTodros Grynhaus was deported by the Israeli authorities to face justice in the UK, with his conviction for sex offences against girls leading to a change in attitudes in the Haredi Jewish community.\nThe case prompted the UK's Chief Rabbi, Ephraim Mirvis, to urge members to report child sex abuse.\nThe court had heard that both women who testified against Grynhaus in the case had been \"ostracised\" by their community as a result of speaking out about their ordeal.\nFor young Muslim girls, the price of speaking out about child sexual abuse can also be high, with many reluctant to report such abuse because of the fear that it would bring shame on them and their family.\nSexual and physical abuse at Islamic religious schools, known as madrassas, has also resulted in some prosecutions in recent years, although often victims still hesitate to come forward with such allegations.\nMany religious organisations will find themselves being closely scrutinised in the national independent inquiry into child sexual abuse,  chaired by New Zealand judge Lowell Goddard.\nThe survivors of such abuse hope that the inquiry will prove itself truly independent, and help ensure that abusers will not be able to rely on their own congregations or religious leaders to protect them - whatever their faith.\nThe Inquiry will investigate a wide range of institutions including:\nLocal authorities\nThe police\nThe Crown Prosecution Service\nThe Immigration Service\nThe BBC\nThe armed forces\nSchools\nHospitals\nChildren's homes\nChurches, mosques and other religious organisations\nCharities and voluntary organisations\nFull details of the inquiry\nCaroline Wyatt's investigation will be broadcast in Radio 4's The Report at 20:00 BST on Thursday, 23 July.",

A little more charm, and a lot less cheap rhetoric, would do much to protect the UK's interests.\"\nHe also said the \"cheerleaders\" for Brexit had shown a \"disregard that amounts to contempt\" towards those that backed the losing side.\nAnd he said the UK would become \"far more dependent\" on the US after it leaves the EU, describing President Donald Trump as \"less predictable, less reliable and less attuned to our free market and socially liberal instincts than any of his predecessors\".\nSir John, who as prime minister between 1990 and 1997 oversaw the start of the Northern Ireland peace process, warned that \"uncertainties over border restrictions\" after Brexit were \"a serious threat to the UK, to the peace process and for Ireland, North and South\".\nThe ex-PM, who faced battles with Eurosceptic MPs during his time in Downing Street, also said Mrs May would have to \"face down\" people calling for \"total disengagement\" from Europe.\nBut the Leave Means Leave campaign hit back, recalling Sir John's famous \"don't bind my hands\" plea to Tory Eurosceptics ahead of EU talks and saying he was now \"seeking to do just this to the British prime minister ahead of negotiations with the EU\".\nConservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg added: \"It was a craven and defeated speech of a bitter man who was heavily defeated by the electorate for his own failings in Europe in 1997, was defeated again last June and now wishes to take out his failures on Mrs May.\"",

Everton offered a stern test and City showed growing maturity to get the three points.\nEverton's superbly drilled defensive formation offered nothing other than frustration to City in the first half as they stood firm.\nMoyes had clearly earmarked Silva as central to City's threat and he deployed youngster Jack Rodwell to man-mark the Spaniard. And when he received a yellow card for a foul on Silva responsibility briefly switched to Phil Neville, until he drew similar punishment from referee Webb after a clash with Silva.\nSergio Aguero was City's main threat in the early exchanges, but it was the 53rd minute before Everton posed a serious threat as Tim Cahill's header from Seamus Coleman's cross floated over the bar.\nIt was only when Balotelli came on for Edin Dzeko on the hour that City made serious inroads into the Everton defence.

Everton substitute Royston Drenthe lost possession in midfield and Silva threaded through a perfect invitation for Milner to slide his finish past Howard.\nEverton had offered next to nothing in terms of attacking threat, although another City substitute Stefan Savic made a timely intervention in injury time to clear Marouane Fellaini's shot off the line.\nLive text commentary",

So, by any measure that is unacceptable.\n\"That is thousands of patients, the majority of whom are elderly, ready to go back home or into the community but can't because the extra support they need just isn't there.\"\nShe also claimed that delayed discharge got worse during the peak of summer despite Health Secretary Shona Robison saying in February that she wanted to \"completely eradicate\" the problem.\nThe substance is this. In the middle of a flood of stats, Ms Sturgeon said: \"Having delivered the target of zero delays over six weeks, we have progressively toughened that target.\"\nA delay of that duration, for the avoidance of doubt, involves a patient being kept in hospital for at least six weeks longer than clinically necessary, generally because no alternative care is available.\nDr Simpson said he had checked with parliament's own information centre. Based on that research, allied to his own knowledge, he believed the First Minister's remarks were misleading.\nAccording to Labour, Scotland's patients had not enjoyed \"zero delays over six weeks\" for three years. That is, there had been patients during that three-year period who had stayed more than six weeks in hospital beyond potential discharge.\nThe immediate response from the First Minister's office is that the target - of zero delays over six weeks - had been met in the past. The general tenor of her remarks was that matters were improving - while there remained more to be done.\nDr Simpson has now, in effect, suggested that Ms Sturgeon might reconsider that stance.\nRead more from Brian\nMs Sturgeon responded by acknowledging that there was still work to do, but said \"real progress\" was being made.\nShe later added: \"Since 2007 there's been a 52% reduction in delays over four weeks, a 55% reduction in delays over six weeks, the number of delays over three days is down by 50%, the number of delays over four weeks has been reduced as well.\n\"Having delivered the target of zero delays over six weeks, we've progressively toughened that target and we're now focusing on ensuring patients are discharged within 72 hours.\"\nThat comment drew an angry response from Labour MSP Dr Richard Simpson, who subsequently made a formal point of order to the presiding officer.\nDr Simpson said that the six-week target had been missed in every month since 2012.\nHe also said that official statistics showed that more than 4,700 patients had been delayed more than six weeks despite being fit to leave since 2012, and nearly 400 in the past two months alone.\nDr Simpson added: \"We all know that nationalist rhetoric is divorced from reality but this is completely unacceptable.  It was completely wrong to claim that these targets had been met when in reality thousands of patients had waited in hospital beds.\n\"Our NHS is in real trouble. The health minister pledged to abolish delayed discharge by the end of the year. Instead it is going in the wrong direction. Meanwhile we see the first minister is making completely false claims about her government's record.\n\"Patients and staff don't benefit from bogus claims about NHS performance. The first minister should correct the record, and this SNP government should get a grip of delayed discharge rather than bury their heads in the sand.\"\nBut a Scottish government spokeswoman said: \"The first minister was correct that the old six week target was met, on a number of occasions, under this government.\n\"Subsequently, the Scottish government introduced new tougher targets that no patient should wait more than four weeks, and later two weeks, from when they are clinically ready for discharge.\n\"Working with our partners in local government we've made the level of performance we expect tougher still, with an ambition for patients to be delayed for no more than 72 hours.\"",

Even though he was a young man then too, the other players all thought the same.\nCharacter is a bit of a buzzword these days, but as a player I looked around for team-mates who had the ability to handle pressure and Tim was always one of them.\nAt 46, he is a relatively young manager now, certainly in terms of experience, but you have to remember he was quite a young captain at Blackburn too - he was 26 when we were champions.\nWe had some pretty big-hitters in terms of personalities in that dressing room, the likes of Alan Shearer, David Batty, Tim Flowers and Colin Hendry.\nThey were never afraid to have their say but, if you speak to them, they will all tell you they admired Tim not just for what he brought to the team as a player but also his contribution to the club's success as captain.\nFor Tim to be skipper ahead of, say, Shearer shows you what the Blackburn boss Kenny Dalglish thought of him too.\nHe always had the leadership qualities you need as a manager and, on top of that, I always thought he was extremely knowledgeable about the game.\nHe comes across as confident or even cocky in some respects, but in the dressing room it doesn't matter whether you are an introvert or an extrovert as long as what you are saying makes sense. Tim always did.\nSo it does not surprise me that, as a manager, he has got the best out of players who had been under-performing - like Emmanuel Adebayor at Spurs or Christian Benteke and Fabian Delph at Villa last season - because he has always had the ability to get people playing for him.\nAt times he might say things that players don't like - because he tells the truth. That ruffles a few feathers but I don't mind it, in fact he should be commended for it.\nThese days I hear a lot of people in football say things with no substance behind them, but Tim certainly is not like that - he can always back his opinions up.\nTim earned his right to have a proper crack at being Villa boss with the incredible job he did to keep them up after taking charge in February, when they were in desperate trouble with a dreadful scoring record.\nVilla have been fighting relegation for a few years now under several different managers so this season was never going to be any different.\nBut, just eight games into the new campaign and at the first sign of adversity, Sherwood already appears to be under massive pressure.\nYou have to take into consideration that he lost his two best players over the summer in striker Benteke and midfielder Delph, who were both inspirational for him last season, and realise he is trying to build a new team with all the signings that Villa have made.\nVilla's net spend over the summer was under £10m - and a lot of that went on young players with little or no Premier League experience.\nThey have plenty of potential, and also plenty of sell-on value which seems to be a big part of the club's thinking, but it is a gamble whether they work out for Villa now and that is Sherwood's problem.\nI don't know who had the final say on each deal but from what I understand, Villa's head of recruitment Paddy Reilly and sporting director Hendrik Almstadt play a big part in the process.\nYou cannot blame Tim for the squad not being strong enough if it is not just down to him, but he is the one who is being criticised because Villa have not won since the opening day.\nI get why the club's owner Randy Lerner might be getting twitchy because of the amount of money at stake if they go down, but the logical thing to do is to give Sherwood more time because he is an intelligent man who has already shown he can improve players - which is exactly what Villa need now.\nSherwood has chopped and changed his team and formation a lot so far, but that is only because he is trying to find the right balance between attack and defence while he beds those new signings in and finds a system that works with the players he has got.\nThe choices he has to make with his current forwards is an example of how difficult that is.\nLike Benteke, Rudy Gestede has tremendous physical attributes and is as good as there is in the air in the Premier League.\nIn an effort to make the most of that, Sherwood has tried to get his full-backs forward to get crosses into the box - Jordan Amavi and Alan Hutton or Leandro Bacuna have all done that far more than any of Villa's midfielders.\nBut what Gestede doesn't have is the ability to link up play, or the pace to get behind defences. In that way, Benteke was much more of an all-round striker.\nSherwood can leave out Gestede and play Gabriel Agbonlahor or Jordan Ayew if he wants pace, but then he does not have that same physical presence up front, or any aerial threat.\nWhoever he picks, he is missing something that Benteke provided on his own.\nBecause he is trying to find that balance between attack and defence, he cannot always play two up front to solve that problem, especially because he is also trying to fit Jack Grealish into his team as an attacking midfielder.\nGrealish is a young player who has a lot of talent but picking him creates a different issue because winning games is not just down to what happens when you have got the ball.\nHowever good Grealish is going forward, he does not always put in a shift going back the other way.\nWhen you lose possession, you need to be compact and tight defensively and Villa have lacked that in the games I have seen, notably in their defeat by Leicester when they were hit on the counter-attack time and time again.\nYou really need defensive responsibility when you are in Villa's position near the bottom of the table.\nThat might be one of the reasons why Sherwood has apparently used this international break to try to get Grealish fitter.\nAfter trying so many formations and line-ups, maybe we will see Sherwood sticking with just one in the next five or six games.\nA settled system and some continuity is what Villa need at the moment. Tim knows that and, if he is given the chance, I am confident he will get it right.\nChris Sutton was speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.",

If I have money to go, I will go. I will take advantage of my age and my energy to help you out.'\"\nAbout half of the young people from Gonzaga move abroad in the hope of securing a better future.\nThe Home Office said Mr Menezes had been granted entry to the UK for six months as a visitor on his arrival on 13 March 2002.\nHe then applied for leave to remain as a student, which was approved. He was granted leave to remain until 30 June 2003.\nThe Home Office says his visa expired at that time and that he remained illegally in the UK until his death.\nLike many Brazilians in London, Mr Menezes would send money home to his parent's modest farm in Gonzaga.\n\"He didn't make a lot of money,\" his father said. \"Most of his money went on rent and food.\n\"He wanted to stay for another two years to save money so he could come back and invest in a ranch.\"\nHe said his son was happy in London.\nFriends say Mr Menezes was as shocked as all Londoners by the 7 July 2005 Tube and bus bombings, as well as the attempted London public transport attacks on Thursday 21 July - the day before he was shot.\nGésio César D'avila, a friend and colleague, said Mr Menezes had considered alternative transport after the failed attacks.\n\"We were together on Thursday, and when we saw what happened, Jean said he wanted to buy a motorbike to avoid the Tube,\" he said.\nOn 22 July, the day Mr Menezes was killed, police and soldiers had been watching the block of flats in Tulse Hill, where the electrician lived.\nThey believed Hussain Osman, one of the failed 21 July bombers, was living there.

The shrine of flowers, candles, pictures and newspaper articles became a gathering point for campaigners seeking answers over the incident.\nAlmost a year after his death, the Crown Prosecution Service announced that no officers would be prosecuted, but the Met Police would be tried for breaching health and safety laws.\nOn 1 November 2007, the force was found guilty at the Old Bailey of endangering the public over the operation that led to the shooting and fined £175,000 with £385,000 costs. A jury found the force broke health and safety laws when officers pursued Mr Menezes and shot him seven times\nAn inquest into Mr Menezes death began on 22 October 2008. The jury rejected the police account Mr de Menezes was killed lawfully by two officers and returned an open verdict. The coroner had instructed the jury not to return a verdict of unlawful killing, and gave it the choice of two possible verdicts.\nThe Met Police settled a damages claim with Mr Menezes family in 2009. The amount of compensation the family will receive was not disclosed.\nIn January 2010, Menezes family members and campaigners gathered at Stockwell station on what would have been his 32nd birthday to unveil a permanent memorial.

But more extraordinarily, the researchers found that the mineral contains about 1% water.\nWhile this sounds like very little, because ringwoodite makes up almost all of this immense portion of the deep Earth, it adds up to a huge amount of deep water.\nDr Sally Gibson from the University of Cambridge, who was not involved in the work, commented: \"Finding water in such large concentrations is a hugely significant development in our understanding of the ultimate origin of water now present at Earth's surface.\"\nThe observation is the first physical evidence that water can be stored in the deep interiors of planets and solves a 25-year-old controversy about whether the deep Earth is dry, wet, or wet in patches.\nDiscussing his findings, Prof Pearson told BBC News: \"The discovery highlights the unique value of natural diamonds in trapping and preserving fragments of the deep Earth.\n\"It's incredible to think that, as you hold this sample in your hand, the residual pressure at the interface between the diamond and the inclusion is 20,000 atmospheres.\"\nDescribing his diamond sample, he said: \"It looks like it's been to hell and back, which it has.\"\nProf Joseph Smyth of the University of Colorado has spent many years studying ringwoodite and similar minerals synthesised in his laboratory.\nHe said: \"I think it's stunning!

Their subject is in his mid-30s, has a full head of hair and is strangely familiar. He's not French, but he's fluent. Only when the cameraman asks him to say his name does the penny drop.\n\"Je m'appelle Vernon Anthony Cotter.\"\nFor four and a half minutes he doesn't miss a beat - and why would he? Cotter had been in the country for years by then. Four seasons playing in the back row with Rumilly in the south-east, two years with Lourdes in the foothills of the Pyrenees, a year with Saint-Junien in west-central France and he would soon kick on for the small southern village of Castelnau-Riviere-Basse, where he played and coached while briefly contemplating a new life as a winemaker.\nCotter is now sitting in Murrayfield talking about the past, the present, the future. The New Zealander has been Scotland coach for 31 Test matches - 16 victories, 15 defeats, nine of which were by seven points or less, five of them by three or less.\nHe's given a first cap to 26 players. Eighteen of the squad he has just named for the Six Nations have appeared on his watch.\nHe has just five more Tests before France reclaims him. Montpellier await. Time for reflection, then. Time to remember where Cotter came from and where he has taken Scotland in his two and a half eventful years.\nCotter is big into culture. Rugby culture. He learned about it first as a player with Counties in New Zealand but a lot of his knowledge came in those early years in France. \"I used to think I was a reasonably physical player, but I was a baby,\" he says.\nI understand New Zealanders so much more after living in Scotland because a lot of the influence comes from here\n\"I learned a lot about character and defending the jersey. You couldn't help but get swept away. The French flair - I used to laugh at that. It wasn't true. Overlaps were created because two forward packs were generally having a good whack at each other.\"\nHe tells a story about a derby match from the mid-90s, his own Lourdes team versus Pau. No love lost between them. In their previous meeting there'd been \"scuffles\" and Lourdes had come off second best.\n\"Our players were doing cartwheels going on to the paddock,\" Cotter recounts. \"The coach said, 'Right boys, tactics for the day. The first five [eighth] kick it straight into the stand and we run up and punch them.' That's what happened. I had somebody who had given me a gentle tickle in the away game and I managed to line him up.\n\"There was an all-out brawl, but no penalty. We had a scrum in midfield and our locks came through and caressed the opposition front row a little bit with their hands. A couple of them needed treatment and we scored a try from there. It was an insight.\n\"It wasn't just a game. I enjoyed the fact that you were playing for your town and your colours. They could be absolute psychopaths on the paddock and gentlemen afterwards.\"\nYears later, while coaching at Clermont, Cotter was given a nickname - les yeux de glace ('eyes of ice'). Years after that, in Scotland, he was christened Stern Vern. To understand what makes him tick, the period of his life in a country where he's already done 17 years, and where he will soon return for another three, is important.\nEight seasons at Clermont turned Cotter into one of the hottest coaching tickets in world rugby. The season before he took over, the club finished a poor eighth in the French championship. In his first year - and for the three years that followed - they made the final.\nIn 2010 they won the first league title in their history. Cotter - with his great friend Joe Schmidt as assistant coach - had become immortal in the French game.\nClermont were never out of the top four on Cotter's watch. Then, the move to Scotland. Not a lot of people in France could understand why he did it. Going to New Zealand, they would have understood. England, they could get. Ireland, perhaps. But Scotland?\n\"It's something that I didn't have to do, it's something that we wanted to do as a family,\" he explains.\n\"One of the key motivating factors was that people [in France] would take the mickey out of Scotland and its rugby. It sort of upset me. I was defending the underdog.\n\"Before the Six Nations, everybody would take a sweepstake and Scotland was always last pick.\n\"Look, I remember the 1990s. I remember Scotland coming to New Zealand [in the summer of 1990] and they should have beaten the All Blacks. We weren't inventing the game, Scotland were doing it. When we first came together as a squad we looked at some footage of those days. They were brave, confident warriors.\n\"Trying to bring that back to Scotland was one of the key things. They [Jim Telfer and Ian McGeechan, the coaches of the era] were ahead of their time. Any comparison to those two great men is very nice. I would take inspiration from what they did. The game has moved on but some of the essential things they were coaching are still relevant, especially to the Scottish psyche.\n\"Scotland has a proud history. It's a humble country and it's a place you can become attached to very quickly.\"\nIn Cotter's first Six Nations, in 2015, Scotland got whitewashed, Wooden-spooned and, at times, embarrassed. Last season brought progression. The brilliance and pain of the near-miss against Australia in the World Cup, the home win against France in the Six Nations, the fact - incredible as it seems - that 2016 was the first time in the 17-year history of the competition that Scotland managed to score more points than they conceded, and hit double figures for tries scored.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nScotland have become an exciting team. More than at any point since last winning the championship under Telfer in 1999, they're posing a threat to the big nations.\n\"The principal foundations are mindset and skill-set,\" says Cotter. \"It was about creating clarity.\n\"The other thing is leadership, creating a leadership group so that they determine behaviour and standards because it's always much easier when you have a group that can think on its feet, that's autonomous. I think that's where we're getting.\n\"You've got a team that's experienced some good things and some bad things. We've become aware of what we can do. Winning is the most important thing. So how do we win? We go through a painful process of learning how to win.\n\"There's been improvement. Would we have liked quicker improvement? Yeah, we probably would. Would we have liked to nail some of those close games? Yes. But we've used them as benchmarks.\"\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nOn the opening day of the Six Nations, Ireland come to Edinburgh. \"We played them at the end of the competition in the last two years and their strength in depth showed through,\" Cotter recalls.\n\"We have more depth now to stay a bit more robust until the end. I'd like to think this game will be closer than those two.\n\"It's a really big challenge for our guys. Joe [Schmidt, Ireland coach] is a really good friend and we'll probably have a beer afterwards. Unfortunately, he's always the one with the smile on his face - and I'd like it to stop. I'd like to get one back on him.\"\nBeyond that, it's a trip to France, then a visit from Wales, then a journey down to England. Scotland have moved forward, but that's no guarantee of victories in the coming weeks.\n\"We know that these teams are very good,\" he insists. \"When they see us on the fixture list they know they're going in as favourites, very confident that they'll beat us. It's our job to try to surprise them somehow, to have something that will take them away from the comfort zone and create errors in their game that we can exploit.\"\nFive more games and then he's away. It's not the way he planned it. It's just the way it is, he says.\nWhen the news broke that this was going to be Cotter's final Six Nations, an audible gasp could have been heard around Scottish rugby. There had been little hint of it, no suggestion his time was coming to an end.\nHe would have preferred to stay on, but Gregor Townsend was ready for an elevation and there was only one way that was going to happen.\nWill he miss it? \"Undoubtedly, but we'll come back on holiday,\" he says. \"You never know, you might find that Glasgow are in Montpellier's pool next year in European rugby.\n\"It was always going to be the deal. The SRU had made it known at the outset that they'd like a Scottish coach in the national position sooner or later and I respect entirely the decision. Would I have liked to continue? Yeah, probably would have, but that's the way it is.\"\nCotter, without doubt, has been good for Scotland but he says Scotland has been good for him, too.\n\"I understand New Zealanders so much more after living in Scotland because a lot of the influence comes from here,\" he explains. \"I recognise it in our rural communities.\n\"I'm not an extroverted person - I'm introverted, I'm quiet - and I love the countryside, I love what Scotland has got to offer, whether it's the coastline, the mountains, the rivers. I enjoyed my time in Colonsay, fishing on the west coast in Plockton, stalking in Glen Shiel.\n\"We've got some good friends in the Borders who love their rugby and it's nice to see their passion. They talk about passion in France, but there's some real passion here for the game.\n\"It's been a privilege, the whole thing. I've only got fond memories. I move on. The game has existed in this country for over a hundred years and it will exist long after I've left. There's another project to move to after I finish here. We were going to go back to New Zealand but then Montpellier came up. They wanted something constructed and the communication I had with the president convinced me that there was perhaps another adventure to take on.\"\nMore than anything he wants to exit on a high. In the coming weeks he says he wants the team to deliver moments that will bond them together not just in the here and now but for decades down the road.\n\"They give everything, these guys,\" he adds. \"They're striving to give people something to be proud of. The stadium is a sell-out for Ireland. So, game on...\"",

Where are these 2,000 people going to come from?\"\n\"They are likely to come from savings made in combat troops. I think that's a mistake.\n\"I think the British forces have already been cut far too much in a very uncertain and increasingly dangerous world.\nHe acknowledged the need for this type of innovation, but said \"it should be added to the forces, not created out of savings found elsewhere.\"\nThe creation of the new unit is part of a major restructuring of the military under the Army 2020 plan, which will see the military scaled down to around 82,000 regular troops in the next five years.\nThe unit will also seek \"new ways of allowing civilians with bespoke skills to serve alongside their military counterparts\".\nThe Army spokesman said it would share the \"spirit of innovation\" of the Chindits in the Burma Campaign of 1942 to 1945.\nChindits was the name given to the Long Range Penetration (LRP) groups that operated in the Burmese jungle behind enemy lines, targeting Japanese communications.\nThe new unit will also use the old Chindit insignia of a Chinthe, a mythical Burmese creature which is half-lion and half-dragon.\nTony Redding from Kent, whose father was in the Chindits, told the BBC he was disappointed by the move. He said: \"Sadly the Ministry of Defence didn't inform the surviving Chindit veterans of the decision to use the badge in this way.\n\"I've tried very hard to look for similarities and the only common denominator I can find is that the Chindits 70 years ago were a highly unconventional force. Perhaps this new force are to use some unconventional means of warfare.\"\nBy BBC defence correspondent Jonathan Beale\nThe Army says it's learnt valuable lessons from Afghanistan - not least that it can't win wars using pure military force alone.\nThe brigade will be made up of warriors who don't just carry weapons, but who are also skilled in using social media such as Twitter and Facebook, and the dark arts of \"psyops\" - psychological operations.\nThey will try to influence local populations and change behaviour through what the Army calls traditional and unconventional means.\nCivilians with the right skills will work alongside regular troops and reservists and could be sent anywhere in the world to help win hearts and minds.\nIt can be seen as proof that the Army is adapting to modern asymmetric warfare, and that it remains relevant at a time when there are fears within the British military of more cuts after the election.\nPaul Rogers, a professor of international security at the University of Bradford, said the announcement represented a \"big expansion\" of the Army's psychological operations and was an \"attempt to rebrand and update\" this area of its work.\n\"We had so much difficulty in Iraq and Afghanistan, it's about trying to learn the lessons of how these groups are using social media,\" Prof Rogers explained.\nHe added: \"In some senses it's defensive - trying to present the case from this side against opponents who hold many of the cards.\n\"We've seen with Islamic State, its incredible capability on the net, Facebook, Instagram and all the rest.\"\nA former Army officer involved in psychological operations in the Balkans, Afghanistan and Iraq, Simon Bergman, predicted it would help build \"the Army for the future\".\n\"For example, 77 brigade have a large component of civil affairs soldiers who'll be operating in populations, working with them, achieving military effects - and a broader effect, because as we know from Afghanistan, the military doesn't work in isolation. It works as a component of government.\"",

On Tuesday, they won at Brocton. The attendance was 87.\nOn Saturday, in excess of 2,000 supporters are expected for the visit of National League North side FC United, who play three tiers above Khalsa, in the FA Cup fourth qualifying round.\nThe winners will earn £12,500 and enter Monday's first-round draw alongside 2008 winners Portsmouth and Wigan, who lifted the trophy by beating Manchester City at Wembley in 2013.\n\"Preparations started on Sunday because we had to clear an access route for vans to bring in the marquees we are having to use because our bar is not big enough,\" said Inder Grewa, one of Sporting Khalsa's 12 owners, who also acts as treasurer.\n\"We have never before had to think about marquees because we normally only have 50 people here.\n\"There was a load of old metal and chairs that needed shifting. Grass verges had to be dug and stone had to be put down to level it off.\n\"At our level we can't afford to pay people to clear the site. We rely on volunteers.\n\"We sent one email out and had around 20 people turn up, including the manager and some of the players.\"\nPrior to this FA Cup run, Sporting Khalsa had never had an attendance in three figures, but there were 750 at the Aspray Arena for the visit of Spalding in the third qualifying round.\nOn Saturday, a combination of local interest and FC United's healthy away following - many of whom are intent on making a trip to nearby Dudley to see the statue of legendary Manchester United and England player Duncan Edwards - could see three times that many turn up.\nNormal home match plans have had to be altered at a club where stadium and bar manager Bal Gacha is the only full-time member of staff.\n\"We usually print the programmes ourselves on a colour printer,\" Grewa told BBC Sport.\n\"But we have not been able to do that this weekend because instead of 20 we have had to get a thousand done.\n\"We have gone up from two stewards to 30.\n\"We have brought the marquees in because we simply could not accommodate the numbers we are expecting in the bar. Food will be available, though.\"\nAh yes, the now famous curry house, located within the 4-4-2 bar adjacent to the ground, open on match and non-matchdays.\n\"We just thought it would be an add-on,\" said Grewa.\n\"We feed the players but football comes first. Everything here is working towards improving the football side.\"\nIt is safe to assume neither Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger nor Aston Villa boss Tim Sherwood were required for landscaping duties before last season's FA Cup final.\nBut that was one of the jobs keeping Sporting Khalsa manager Ian Rowe busy this week after answering the call to help create the access route.\nBuilding is nothing new for this Black Country club, sandwiched between Wolverhampton and Walsall, whose story of traversing one side of Noose Lane, where it all began in 1991, to the other, where the Asprey Arena is located, is a compelling one, even if it comes with a sad reminder that some racial stereotypes still run deep.\nSporting Khalsa emerged from a group of a dozen Sikh lads who would meet on Willenhall Memorial Park for a kickabout at weekends.\nPlaying standards varied. Passion for the game was in them all.\nSporting Khalsa entered the local Walsall and District Sunday League, then moved into Saturday football, pushing the boundaries of what could be achieved.\nIn 2004 they joined the West Midlands Regional League. Three promotions have taken them to the upper echelons of the Midland League.\nDecisions now, as they always have, are achieved through discussion and consensus, sometimes in the car as they travel to away games.\nSporting Khalsa's architects were Asian. Their official website calls them a semi-professional Asian club.\nBut it has always been open to all, regardless of religion, skin colour and gender.\nThey bought a pitch at Bloxwich Town but when Aspray Arena became available after Willenhall Town went into administration in 2009, the opportunity to relocate to a stadium barely 400 yards from the Sunday league pitches where the Sporting Khalsa concept first emerged was too tempting to reject.\n\"There is a group of 12 who you could say are the core of the club,\" said Grewa.\n\"We were always aware some of us could not play at a good standard. But we just love the game - and we wanted to see how far we could push ourselves.\n\"You still get the odd comment. We were at an away match recently and someone said, 'I thought you lot only played cricket', so that stereotype is still there.\n\"It makes me angry that something like that still happens because it is absolutely not true.\n\"We just love football. It doesn't matter to us if you are black, green or yellow. We welcome anybody.\n\"We have kids teams from under-6s upwards and four ladies teams. We are a community club - and the community is everybody.\"\nThe club have ambitions of climbing higher up the football pyramid, but there is also a conflict about how progress could permanently alter the identity of the club.\n\"We want to get to the National League,\" said Grewa.\n\"Once you go into the Football League, it becomes a business. I don't know whether we want that.\n\"The founders of the club have never fallen out. That only happens if there is money involved. As it is, everyone is treated equally.\n\"Up to the National League, we could still do our jobs and handle it.\"\nAt 15:00 BST on Saturday, the dreaming must stop.\nBy any logic, Sporting Khalsa do not stand a chance of bridging the gap to FC United, akin to a League Two side taking on a Premier League team.\nThey do have an international, central defender Tes Robinson, who plays for St Kitts and Nevis. They also have a forward, Craig Bannister, who has scored nine times in this season's FA Cup.\nSaturday's match is Sporting Khalsa's seventh FA Cup tie of the season, more than Arsenal played in lifting the trophy in 2014-15.\nThe players share lifts to away games. Many still play Sunday football in addition to Saturdays. And it was not known for certain until less than 24 hours before they left for their replay against Spalding last week that their goalkeeper and winger would be able to play because of work commitments.\n\"I am a Manchester United fan,\" said manager Ian Rowe, who was appointed at the start of the 2014-15 season.\n\"I have followed the FC United story from the start. Next to having my kids, this will be one of the proudest moments of my life.\n\"But let's not kid ourselves.

Last week, he said women and children were being killed \"in large numbers\" by Russian raids.\nMr Medvedev said Russia was \"not trying to achieve some secret goals in Syria\", adding that \"we are trying to protect our national interests\".\nTheir comments were made at a security conference in Munich, days after world powers agreed a deal to push for a cessation of hostilities in Syria within a week.\nAgreement to try to bring about a cessation of hostilities and allow more access for humanitarian aid was reached by world powers late on Thursday in Germany, but neither the Syrian government nor the rebels were involved.\nUnder the plan, efforts will be made to try to make urgent aid deliveries to besieged and hard-to-reach areas in Syria. Steps will also be taken to work towards an eventual ceasefire and implementation of a UN-backed plan for political transition in Syria.\nThe halt will not apply to the battle against jihadist groups Islamic State (IS) and al-Nusra Front.\nThe tentative deal reached here in Munich to pause the fighting in Syria was always going to be a tough sell to the warring parties on the ground. Now its chances of success look even slimmer - \"Forty-nine per cent,\" said Russia's foreign minister. \"Closer to zero,\" said his British counterpart.\nFor much of the day the Russian and Western ministers have been trading accusations and counter-accusations as to who is to blame for the ongoing misery that is the Syrian civil war.\nFrance, Britain and the US all accused Russia of targeting mainstream rebels and civilians with air strikes while leaving so-called Islamic State largely unscathed. Russia flatly denied this, saying most of those civilians were being besieged by rebels rather than by Assad's forces. Again, Western delegates disagreed.\nSo there are clearly two, diametrically opposed, versions of what is going on in Syria. That leaves little prospect of the concerted effort for peace by all parties that is so desperately needed.\nRebel groups in Syria have told the BBC they would not stop fighting because they do not believe that Russia will end its bombing campaign in support of the government.\nThey also reiterated their demand that President Assad be removed from power. On Friday, the president said he wanted to retake \"the whole country\" from rebels.\nBut US state department spokesman Mark Toner said Mr Assad was \"deluded\" if he thought there was a military solution to the conflict.\nSyrian government forces, backed by Russian air strikes, have almost encircled rebels in parts of the northern city of Aleppo.\nMore than 250,000 people have been killed and some 11 million displaced in almost five years of fighting in Syria.\nIn another sign of the complexity of the conflict, reports said that on Saturday Turkish forces had shelled Kurdish militia targets in Aleppo provinces.\nThe Kurdish fighters had seized territory from Islamists in recent days. Turkey views the Kurdish militia as allied to the PKK group, which has a waged a campaign against Turkish security forces for decades.\nOn Saturday, Turkey's Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said Saudi Arabia would send war planes to the Turkish air base of Incirlik, from where they would attack militants in Syria from the so-called Islamic State.\nSaudi Arabia is already part of the international coalition against IS.\nMr Cavusoglu also said it was possible that troops from his country and Saudi Arabia might participate in a ground operation against IS forces. The US has so far ruled out a ground invasion.\nMoscow has warned against any new foreign ground intervention in the country, saying such a development could even lead to a world war.\nWhy is there a war in Syria?\nAnti-government protests developed into a civil war that, five years on, has ground to a stalemate, with the Assad government, Islamic State, an array of Syrian rebels and Kurdish fighters all holding territory.\nWho is fighting whom?\nGovernment forces concentrated in Damascus and the centre and west of Syria are fighting the jihadists of Islamic State and al-Nusra Front, as well as less numerous so-called \"moderate\" rebel groups, who are strongest in the north and east. These groups are also battling each other.\nHow has the world reacted?\nIran, Russia and Lebanon's Hezbollah movement are propping up the Alawite-led Assad government, while Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Qatar back the Sunni-dominated opposition, along with the US, UK and France. Hezbollah and Iran are believed to have troops and officers on the ground, while a Western-led coalition and Russia are carrying out air strikes.",

Fat, sick, stupid and anxious are no ways to live.\n\"These systems are failing. Let them fail. Change or die.\"\nWhat makes this different from a Moby album?\nI think a lot of people think of me as making sort of down-tempo quiet, electronic living room music and this record is much more of a fast, aggressive post-punk record and, based on the reactions I've had so far, people have been a little nonplussed at that.\nWhat reactions specifically? Do people think you're crazy or are they applauding a brave new direction?\nBoth in equal measure, part of what led me to want to make a record like this, is the awareness that people don't really buy records any more and people especially don't buy records from 51-year-old musicians who are making their 15th record, so with those two things in mind there's also a sense of emancipation that comes with that.\nYou can either bemoan the fact that, in 2016 the audience for albums is quite small, but I see it as being really liberating because there's no external pressure at all. I'm not trying to sell records, I'm not trying to get on the radio, I'm honestly just trying to make a record that excites me and that I think is interesting.\nYou've been very commercially successful and some might say that puts you in the privileged position of not having to worry about it.\nYes and it would be hard for me to argue that. I would feel absurdly presumptuous criticising anyone else's choices, there are a lot of musicians who have children or alimony payments or sick relatives, so they need to make commercial compromises in order to pay the rent. I'm lucky because I live a relatively simple life and I can make whatever music I want to make without any worry about any commercial ramifications.\nIn your mission statement for this project you state: 'When some of my middle-aged compatriots try to accommodate the pop market place, the results are so anodyne and depressing'. Did you have someone specific in mind?\nI did have people in mind but, in the interest of avoiding public feuds, I can't even begin to name names because in the course of my life, whenever I've criticised a fellow musician, it has ended up being something that I have truly regretted. But the truth is that a majority of musicians as they age don't do so in a graceful way. What I mean by that is, I understand that as you age, you want to hold on to your glory days and for most musicians that was decades ago, so you find yourself dressing the same way and touring and taking out your contact lenses so the audience will be blurry and look bigger than it is.  If I don't have to go down that route, I'd just as soon not.\nBut your album Play was the first album to have every track licensed to advertisers - if a corporation came to you now and asked to use Don't Leave Me from the new album - what would you do?\nI have a feeling that on my death bed the last question someone asks me before I die will be about licensing music to advertisements. At this point, most of what I do and I hesitate to say this because it does sound a little self-aggrandising but it's sincere, is that most of the work I do now is non-profit.\nI own a restaurant in LA and 100% of the profits goes to animal welfare charities and my only show this year is a fundraiser for an animal rights group. I don't mean that in a self-congratulatory way, I just mean my criteria has changed. How do my choices benefit the causes that I care about? So, if an advertiser came to me with a dump truck full of money to license a song, I would probably say \"yes\" and simply direct the dump truck to one of the organisations I work with.\nI've always tried to employ that ethos when it comes to advertising,  like \"rob from the rich and give to the poor\" or, more accurately, \"take from corporations and give to those who work against those corporations\". But even when I was being crucified for that, I really didn't want to talk about it because it seemed defensive. It made me uncomfortable trying to justify myself even if there was justification there.\nWith that and the Pacific Void manifesto, it sounds like you're having a conscientious mid-life crisis but, instead of buying a sports car, you're trying to right the world's wrongs.\nI've always been potentially an annoying, opinionated loudmouth. I was raised by very active hippies with an idea that whatever you do, in so far as you can, you should try and make the world a better place. Again, I can't be so presumptuous to say I am making it a better place but at least I want to try. There's so much, especially in the public arena, of this shameless, endless self-promotion that it just makes me nauseous.\nI don't want to be like them, there are too many horrifying pressing issues. Just putting out a new fashion line or lending your name to a perfume company would be fine if the world wasn't an inch away from catastrophe.\nIs this your main creative drive now or will you go back to recording under Moby?\nI made a record about two years ago that was very choral and so I used the name The Void Pacific Choir, which is a DH Lawrence quote because I liked it, but I scrapped the album and then started work on this one but I kept the name. But the truth is that it's me on my own so if I go back and record something under my name, it all seems kind of arbitrary to me.\nDo you intend on touring the new album?\nDear God no. It's another thing that's emancipating . Most musicians put out a record with the intent of touring and my intention is to never tour again as long as I live because I hate touring. I love playing music but going to the same airports and the same hotels and the law of diminishing returns, as you age you play smaller venues and you try and play new songs but the audience just want to hear the hits which I understand because when I go to see middle-aged musicians, I want to see the hits.\nBut if I never ever go on tour again, I would be very happy.\nHave you said everything you need to with this album?\nI've already made the follow-up record, I'm just trying to figure out when my record label will let me release it. Part two is all ready to go but clearly record companies don't love middle-aged musicians who refuse to tour, so I can't be too haughty and high-handed with them. I have to rely on their good graces.\nThe debut album by Moby & The Void Pacific Choir is released 14 October 2016.\nFollow us on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, on Instagram at bbcnewsents, or if you have a story suggestion email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk.",

[Don't worry, BBC graphics designers, I'm not seriously thinking of doing this. Not yet at least!]\nBut the important point here is that the composition of the different magnets and their respective strengths would be very different from one constituency to another.\nIn this era of multi-party politics, every single seat is more or less a law unto itself.\nTake for example two of our key local marginals, Dudley North and Solihull.\nIn the Black Country seat, Labour are defending a majority of just 649.\nIn 2010 their closest challengers were the Conservatives. This time, though, with nine seats on the local council its is UKIP who are breathing down Labour's neck.\nSolihull is another key Conservative target. The Liberal Democrats had a majority over them of just 175 last time round. But since then, the Green Party has established itself as a real force in the town, thanks to a potent combination of green belt and housing issues.\nExtreme examples though they may be, these two constituencies reinforce the point that whether or not UKIP or the Greens succeed in winning seats themselves, or even come close to doing so, they will undoubtedly have significant and differing impacts on the established parties from one seat to another.\nLike a collection of by-elections perhaps?\nThat may be overstating it. But I am becoming increasingly convinced that this election offers us regional and local broadcasters a unique opportunity to explore the local dynamics of individual seats and to explain the possibility that in the shake-out of seats between the biggest parties it is not unreasonable to envisage gains and losses in both directions.\nAnd what does this tell us about those headline national poll ratings pointing to a hung Parliament, in which the two biggest parties in lock step with each other followed by UKIP, the Liberal Democrats and then the Greens?\nOr, about those \"percentage swing to win or lose\" statistics which have been calculated in a predominantly two-party environment?\nAll it tells us is how little they tell us.\n\"Never assume\" said the recently-departed doyen of cricket commentators Richie Benaud.\nIn an election as unpredictable as this, maybe the assumptions about a hung Parliament are themselves suspect. Maybe the answer lies not in the macro but in the micro.\nIn this contest so full of unexpected twists and turns, how surprising would it really be if the result itself were to spring the biggest surprise of all?",

The SNP look likely to be the swing vote in this particular debate.\nElsewhere, there's a new and multi-faceted crime bill, and in the Lords there's some preliminary sparring over the Trade Union Bill. There may also be votes on the Immigration Bill. But it looks as if the Commons-Lords \"ping-pong\" on the proposals to reform Employment Support Allowance for some disabled people may be petering out.\nHere's my rundown of the week ahead:\nThe Commons opens at 2.30pm for Education questions. As usual any post weekend ministerial statements or urgent questions will follow at 3.30pm.\nThen it's the launch of the Policing and Crime Bill, a wide-ranging measure which will:\nIn the Lords (2.30pm) after the usual hour of questions to ministers, it's the latest stage of the parliamentary ping-pong over the Welfare Reform and Work Bill. After MPs rejected a Lords amendment for the second time, it's rumoured peers may drop their resistance to the Commons over benefits for disabled people in the \"Work Related Activities Group\", and content themselves with a \"regret\" motion. Then peers debate the Tax Credits (Income Thresholds and determination of Rates) Regulations 2016 - where the Lib Dems have put down another \"regret motion\" but seem unlikely to attract Labour support.\nAnd that's followed by an International Women's Day debate on the progress of women's representation and empowerment in the UK, 150 years after the 1866 petition for women's suffrage. There are 27 peers down to speak, including two notable maidens - the Conservative Baroness Mone and the Bishop of Gloucester, Rachel Treweek, who will become the first woman Bishop to speak in the Lords.\nThe Commons opens (11.30am) with Justice questions, followed at 12.30pm by a Ten Minute Rule Bill from the Conservative, Will Quince. He's calling for a first aid component to be added to the driving test, continuing the backbench campaign for more first aid training which recently saw a private member's bill which attempted to require First Aid to be taught in schools.\nHe says this would substantially increase the number of Britons with knowledge of first aid - countries like Germany, Switzerland and the Czech Republic already require evidence of first aid training as a condition of having a full driving licence. Mr Quince claims the support of the British Red Cross and St John's Ambulance.\nAfter that, MPs turn to detailed consideration of the Enterprise Bill - Labour and the Green MP Dr Caroline Lucas both have amendments down on the proposed privatisation of the Green Investment Bank, set up under the Coalition; Labour want to preserve its environmental objectives in the private sector, while Dr Lucas wants buyers to commit themselves to maintaining its existing programme.\nAnd there is a series of amendments on the bill's proposal to cap redundancy payments for public sector workers.\nThere will also be a backbench debate to mark International Women's Day, led by the former Cabinet Minister Maria Miller, now chair of the Women and Equalities Committee - the motion calls for more progress in electing women to Parliament, pay parity between men and women and more action against FGM.\nIn Westminster Hall, the opening debate led by the SNP's Dr Lisa Cameron is on puppy farming and the welfare of young dogs bred for sale (9am-11am).  Then Labour's Jo Cox raises the issue of autism diagnosis waiting times - she says many parents are waiting over two years to get an autism diagnosis for their child and says the families should have a diagnosis within a reasonable timeframe.\nAnd at 2.30pm-4pm, the Conservative Simon Hart will lead a debate on the potential economic benefits of the Swansea Tidal Lagoon - a Â£1bn green energy project, which is one of several such schemes proposed along the south coast of Wales. He will seek to explore the likely impact on the local economy and the number of permanent jobs created in Wales - especially if the Newport and Cardiff Schemes come on line. Early predications refer to a Â£20bn inward investment, nearly 2,000 new jobs and an unquantifiable impact on tourism and leisure.\nIn the Lords (2.30pm) there's an International Woman's Day flavour to question time, with questions on: the UN framework preventing violence against women, gender inequality, discriminatory practices and harmful cultural and social norms, from Baroness Kinnock; improving the reading skills of 16 to 24-year-old women, from Baroness Rebuck and on increasing the representation of women in political and public life, from Baroness Gale.\nThen peers turn to the detail of the Housing and Planning Bill - in the fourth day of seven of committee stage - and already the debate is lagging well behind schedule, raising the prospect that the bill might not get to its report stage immediately after Easter, as planned.\nThe sections under scrutiny on Tuesday include right to buy for tenants of housing association properties and high value council property sales. This is the a contentious part of the bill - but, as usual, committee stage debates are preliminary sparring, and no votes are expected; but the debates will foreshadow amendments for report stage, when a serious attempt to re-write these provisions looks likely.\nThere will also be a short debate on a political solution to the civil war in Syria- led by the Bishop of Coventry.\nThe Commons meets at 11.30am - for half an hour of questions to the ministers at the Cabinet Office, the government's \"engine room,\" followed, at noon by questions to the prime minister.\nPlaid Cymru's Liz Saville Roberts has a Ten Minute Rule Bill calling for the law on cyber-crime to be brought together from around 30 different statutes, and for new duties to be imposed on internet service providers and social media companies, to remove offensive material.\nShe has cross party support and this looks very much like the start of a campaign, rather in the tradition of her predecessor, Elfyn Llywd, who scored significant success in toughening up the law on stalking.\nThen MPs move on to the detail of the Enterprise Bill - where the crunch vote will be on an amendment, spearheaded by Tory backbencher David Burrowes, and signed by 22 Conservatives, to delete the government's proposals to loosen restrictions on Sunday trading.\nLabour will be whipped to back it, the Northern Ireland DUP is on board - but it looks as if the SNP will not be. There's also an amendment from the former Cabinet Minister Caroline Spellman which would allow a limited relaxation in Sunday opening hours for larger shops.\nThe day's Westminster Hall debates cover BT service standards (9.30am-11am); the government's proposals on fixed recoverable costs in clinical negligence claims (11am-11.30am); the contribution of the Scotch whisky industry to the UK economy (2.30pm-4pm); the management of the Health and Safety Executive (4pm- 4.30pm) and competition in the UK energy market (4.30-5.30pm).\nIn the Lords (3pm) peers launch into the report stage of the Immigration Bill, where votes are expected on amendments dealing with overseas domestic workers and permission to work for asylum seekers. Watch out, too, for an amendment from Lords Alton and Forsyth, and Baroness Cox, to guarantee asylum for people fleeing genocide, as defined in the International Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of Genocide; and from Lord Dubs, to allow for asylum for people employed by the UK Government in Iraq or Afghanistan.\nThe really big clash over this bill, on unaccompanied child migrants, will come the following week - unless the government makes a pre-emptive concession.\nThere will be a lot of interest on the debate on the report from the special committee set up to examine the impact on trade union political funds and (Labour) party funding (the Burns Report, after the crossbench peer who chaired the committee).\nThe Committee suggested a number of fixes which would reduce the impact of the current proposals in the Trade Union Bill - which have been denounced as a partisan attack by the government on Labour.\nThis will be the first chance to debate them and to get a response from ministers. And the committee report will tee up a series of amendments when the bill comes to report stage, on Wednesday 16 March. Opposition parties are waiting to see the colour of the minister's money on this issue - but even if the government signs up to the Burns Report compromise, there's still plenty left in this bill to argue about - not insisting on postal ballots and allowing e-voting for union ballots, the \"check-off\" system for deducting union subs from pay-packets, facility time for union reps and much more.\nThe various sides are still circling each other and we could still see a long drawn-out bout of trench warfare when report stage commences.\nThe Commons opens (9.30am) with Transport questions, followed by the weekly Business Statement from the Leader of the House, Chris Grayling. He will be under considerable pressure to announce the dates of forthcoming parliamentary recesses, and of the next Queen's Speech. MPs are particularly keen to know whether there will be a recess covering the EU Referendum and whether the the start of the next parliamentary year will be put back until after the referendum, implying a State Opening ceremony in July.\nThen MPs turn to the report stage and third reading of the Northern Ireland (Stormont Agreement and Implementation Plan) Bill 2015-16, which implements the latest deal on the powers of the Northern Ireland Assembly. The scheduling implies that the powers that be don't expect any great controversy over this measure, and that the debate will be fairly brief.\nThe decision to end the centuries-old practice of recording Acts of Parliament on vellum - treated cow skin - will be raised in a Backbench Business Committee debate. James Gray, a member of the House of Commons Commission, which signed up to that decision (which came from the Lords) wants to carry on using vellum - and it may all come down to how much it would cost to keep it, and who pays.\nIn the Lords (from 11am) peers debate the detailed provisions on \"pay to stay\" and ending secure tenancies, in the Housing and Planning Bill (see Tuesday, above).\nThere will also be a short debate on the renewal of the BBC's Charter, led by the Liberal Democrat Baroness Bonham-Carter. As I write there are 16 peers are down to speak, which is quite a turnout for a short debate on a Thursday - suggesting there's a considerable level of interest in this issue in the Upper House.\nThe Commons meets (9.30am) to debate private members' bills - I'll list what's down on the Order Paper at the moment, but it's an increasingly inaccurate guide to what actually happens on the day. The main reason for this is that we're now approaching the end of the parliamentary year, where cunning operators like the wily Peter Bone angle to get second reading debate on issues they want to raise - although they then have little prospect of becoming law.\nBut the announcement of the date of the EU referendum has put Mr Bone, one of the prime movers in the increasingly important Grassroots Out organisation, into campaign mode, and he has not been able to be in the Chamber to move some of the many bills he has put down for debate.\nHis close ally, Christopher Chope, has stepped into the breach to move some of those bills - specialising in the ones with an EU dimension. But sadly we're unlikely to get a debate on the Prime Minister (Temporary Appointment) Bill, which would have provided a mechanism, in case the PM was run over by a bus.\nFor the record, the current batting order is:  Foreign National Offenders (Exclusion from the UK) Bill (Peter Bone); National Health Service Bill (Caroline Lucas); Criminal Cases Review Commission (Supplementary Powers) Bill (Andy McDonald); Regulation of Enforcement Agents (Collection of Council Tax Arrears) Bill (Yvonne Fovargue); Health Services Commissioning (Equality and Accountability) (No. 2) Bill (Rehman Chishti); Perinatal Mental Illness (NHS Family Services) Bill (Rehman Chishti); Scotland Act 1998 (Amendment) Bill (Angus Brendan MacNeil) and the House of Lords (Parliamentary Standards Etc) Bill (Sir Edward Leigh).\nThere are many more bills listed, and if some of those above are not moved, they may even be debated - if their movers are there to do so.\nIt's also private members' bill day in the Lords (10am) where peers will consider the Gambling (Categorisation and Use of B2 Gaming Machines) Bill and the Criminal Cases Review Commission (Information) Bill.

I hit the first one as hard as I really could considering how close the pin was to the edge of the green.\"\nThe world number four went straight to the practice green after taking 35 putts in round one but he said his efforts on Friday, when he took 30, were \"pathetic\".\n\"Putting let me down at [the US Open in June at] Oakmont and then putting let me down here again,\" he said.\n\"My tee to green game - there's not much wrong with that. It's pretty solid. If you had given anyone else in this field my tee shots this week, they would have been up near the top of the leaderboard.\n\"It just shows you how bad I was around the greens.\"\nThe Swede was grouped with the year's other two major winners - Masters champion Danny Willett and US Open victor Dustin Johnson - and he outscored them on both days.\nHe dropped to one under par after three-putt bogeys on the 12th and 13th holes but a three-foot eagle putt on the par-five 18th, his ninth, followed by three birdies on the front nine, moved him one clear of the field.\n\"I got off to a bit of a wobbly start and stood over a six-foot putt on the 14th to avoid going three over, so I'm quite happy that went in and I turned it on from 18,\" said the 40-year-old, who won his first major at Royal Troon two weeks ago.\n\"That could easily have gone the wrong way but I was hanging in there and got the good stuff coming in.\"\nWillett birdied the ninth to card a 70 and make the cut on one over, but pre-tournament favourite Johnson is going home after adding a 72 to his opening 77 for a nine-over total.\nNeither American has never won a major and while Walker has five victories on the PGA Tour, Streb has just one and has missed nine cuts in 23 events in 2016.\nWalker, 37, made a solid start to round two with two birdies and seven pars in his opening nine holes before moving clear of the field with a run of three successive birdies from the 12th.\nHe pulled his tee shot on the 17th into a hospitality area and escaped with a free drop and par five but an almost identical shot on the last was not so lucky, ending up in a lake and resulting in a dropped shot.\n\"The finish wasn't what I was looking for, but it's fine,\" said Walker. \"I think you take 66 at any tournament all day every day.

I just can't get a putt to go in from beyond 10 feet.\"\nKaymer, who started at four under, began the front and back nines with bogeys but three birdies in his last four holes lifted him to five under.\n\"I made a few putts here and there.

And it's just nice, man. It's a nice atmosphere.\"\nLee Westwood (70) hit 92% of greens in regulation as he also finished on one under, alongside fellow Englishmen Ross Fisher (73) and Tyrrell Hatton (68).\nAndy Sullivan, who reached five under, dropped away with six bogeys in nine holes through the middle of his round before finishing birdie-eagle on the two par-five finishing holes to post a 71 and a two-under total that matched Paul Casey (69).\nScotland's Russell Knox is also playing the weekend after a second 70 left him level par, along with Wales' Bradley Dredge.\nEnglish pair Matthew Fitzpatrick (70) and Justin Rose (72) beat the cut by one shot.",

That's the usual sequence of events.\nBut today the independent reviewer was criticising the process before the new Counter-Terror and Security Bill was published.\nThe QC used his customary polite, sometimes understated, tone - but this was a criticism of politicians whom he said hadn't fully thought through some of the proposals announced in early September.\nRead more from Robin\nMrs May's new measures to tackle terrorism come days after she said the UK faces a \"greater\" terror threat than ever before.\nThe measures include requiring airlines to pass on details of their passengers and changes to the way TPIMs - Terrorism Prevention and Investigation Measures - work to monitor terror suspects who cannot be prosecuted.\nBut campaigners have condemned it, saying it threatens civil liberties.\n'A more sensible way'\nMr Anderson - appointed by the government to be its independent reviewer of terrorism legislation - said the new anti-terror legislation was \"nothing like as dramatic\" as David Cameron had proposed earlier this year.\nHe told the Joint Committee on Human Rights the original plan to block suspected British jihadists returning from Iraq and Syria as \"an announcement waiting for a policy\".\nBut he said it soon became clear such a move would \"neither legally or practically\" work and the current plan was now much \"closer to managed return\".\nHe argued there could be \"a more sensible\" way of dealing with some people suspected of being involved in terrorist activities.\n\"One could look at it in terms of young, possibly vulnerable people caught up with the wrong crowd in Syria - didn't really know exactly what they were doing,\" he said.\n\"Do you want to throw the book at them straight away in terms of arrest and charge? Or is there something to be said, even though you do suspect them of having fought, of keeping them under a very light regime where they might have to report daily to a police station?\nThe new Counter-Terrorism and Security Bill includes:\n\"They might have to notify their residence; they might have to go along to meetings with probation or with some similar which perhaps might be for some people be a more sensible way of dealing with them than putting them straight into the criminal justice process.\"\nMr Anderson said the use of exclusion orders would require the cooperation of carriers, such as airlines and of states where these people might find themselves.\n\"But certainly presented with an order at the check-in desk, the person might say: 'I want to come home,' or decide not to come home,\" he said.\n\"The concern I have about this power and the central concern about it is: where are the courts in all of this?\n\"If the home secretary wants to impose a TPIM she has to go to the court first and if the court says she's got it wrong, it will say so.\n\"One will want to look very carefully to see if this is a power that requires the intervention of the court at any stage, or whether it's simply envisaged as something the home secretary imposes.\n\"If one is abroad when this order is served on you, then it's a little difficult to see in practical terms how a right to judicial review could be exercised.\"\nMr Anderson spoke out as a week-long counter-terrorism awareness campaign enters its third day.\n'Changing threats'\nThe UK's terror threat level remains \"severe\" after it was upped from \"substantial\" earlier this year in response to conflicts in Iraq and Syria.\nSpeaking ahead of the bill's publication, Mrs May said: \"We are in the middle of a generational struggle against a deadly terrorist ideology. These powers are essential to keep up with the very serious and rapidly changing threats we face.\n\"This bill includes a considered, targeted set of proposals that will help to keep us safe at a time of very significant danger by ensuring we have the powers we need to defend ourselves.\"\nThe government wants to \"fast-track\" the bill through Parliament, citing the need to tackle the direct threat posed by the group calling itself Islamic State (IS) and the increasing number of Britons travelling to Iraq and Syria to fight on its behalf.\nBut shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said more was needed to be done to stop British citizens from being radicalised and to deal with any threat this posed to national security.\nAmnesty International called the powers \"draconian\", adding none of the measures seemed \"properly thought through\".\nAnd Shami Chakrabarti, director of human rights group Liberty, said: \"Yet again, politicians resort to high talk and rushed legislation in an attempt to look tough in the face of terrorism. Another chilling recipe for injustice and resentment by closing down the open society you seek to promote.\"\nThe Home Office says communications data has played a major role in \"every Security Service counter-terrorism operation over the last decade\" but gaps in the UK's access to such information need to be filled.\nMrs May has warned that even the new data retention powers will not fully address the threat, reiterating the need for a Communications Data Bill to bring in more wide-ranging web monitoring powers.\nThat bill - labelled a snooper's charter by critics - was scrapped following Lib Dem opposition.\nTechnology firms said there had been insufficient consultation on the more limited proposals in the bill requiring firms to keep information to help the authorities to match internet protocol (IP) addresses to an individual user or a device.\nThe Home Office said it had met internet service providers and other groups to discuss the measures but the Internet Services Providers Association said there had been \"a distinct lack of engagement\" with the industry.\nMinisters want to amend legislation passed earlier this year to require firms to retain data, including that \"required to identify the sender or recipient of a communication, the time or duration of a communication, the type, method or pattern of communication and the telecommunications system used\".\nHowever, the bill stresses that the content of messages and details that would \"explicitly identify\" what websites someone had visited would not have to be stored.\nOn Tuesday a report into last year's killing of Fusilier Lee Rigby raised questions about whether social network providers should have to report details of extremist activity.\nDavid Cameron said companies had a \"social responsibility\" to act on terrorist material posted online after the report detailed how Michael Adebowale, one of two men convicted of Mr Rigby's murder, spoke on Facebook about wanting to murder a soldier.\nFacebook said it did not allow terrorist content and aimed to stop it.",

I felt I had been tossed to the one side, I had no feelings of self worth,\" added Mr Birnie.\nSeveral months after the incident, Mr Birnie made an official complaint to the Northern Health and Social Care Trust.\nIn a letter to Mr Birnie dated October 2015 and seen by the BBC, the trust explained that as he was so unwell they had spoken to his sister.\nThe trust also said that if the infection had caused his heart to stop, medical staff would not have been able to bring him back and that attempts at cardio respiratory resuscitation would not have been in his best interests.\nHowever, Mr Birnie said he does not accept that a DNR notice was placed on his file in advance of him being admitted without his or his sister's consent.\nIn a statement to the BBC, a spokesperson for the Northern Health Trust confirmed that a DNR notice was placed on Mr Birnie's file in January 2014, but not before a conversation had taken place with their patient.\n\"The decision to implement a DNR is a medical one, which is taken in cases where medical professionals feel that if a person's medical condition at that time causes their heart to stop, resuscitation attempts would be futile and therefore not in their best interests in providing a dignified death.\n\"This was discussed with Mr Birnie initially and was put in place following a conversation with his next of kin who indicated that they had talked it over with Mr Birnie and agreed with the decision taken,\" the statement said.\n\"A DNR notice is reviewed and, if felt appropriate, renewed on a daily basis. There is currently no DNR on Mr Birnie's file and his treatment remains unaffected.\"\nA DNR notice is an extremely sensitive issue. Often the subject can arise when a person least expects it or is not in a position to make a rational judgement.\nThe order means medical staff will not attempt to bring the patient back to life if they stop breathing or their heart stops.\nThe decision to use one is ultimately a doctor's, but official guidelines from the British Medical Association (BMA) state medical staff have a duty to discuss it with relatives wherever possible.\nThe problem for medical staff is that sometimes the conversation between doctor and the patient or family may not take place in time.\nThe usual circumstances in which it is appropriate not to resuscitate are when it will not restart the heart or breathing; when there is no benefit to the patient; and when the benefits are outweighed by the burdens.\nThe guidelines also say that it should only be issued after discussions with the patient or family.\nHowever, according to Neill Birnie that did not happen.\nAs a quadriplegic who requires 24-hour care via the computer, he told me he is still a human being with feelings: \"The lights are still on and I am definitely at home.\"\nVia his voice-activated computer, he told a rude joke that made me laugh. He smiled through his eyes.\nAt times, there were tears in his eyes.\nEarlier this year, a study by the Royal College of Physicians in England found one in five families was not consulted when doctors had decided not to revive their relative.\nThe study was taken from just over 9,000 dying patients.",

        "output": "British Gas and EDF have announced price reductions of 5.1% and 5%, respectively. These cuts benefit customers on standard domestic gas and electricity tariffs. The moves come after a 57% drop in wholesale gas prices since last year, and all big six energy suppliers have made similar reductions. However, consumer groups have raised questions about the effectiveness of competition in the market. British Gas said around 6.8 million customers would save an average of Â£31 per year, while EDF estimated 900,000 customers would save Â£31. While these tariffs are among the most expensive, shopping around for better deals could save consumers more money. Energy analysts noted that electricity tariffs have not been reduced despite falling wholesale costs, due to environmental costs and network charges. The industry is awaiting the outcome of a competition watchdog investigation. The Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change Amber Rudd said more needed to be done to ensure consumers were not getting a \"rough deal.\"",

From the point of view of the government whips this afternoon's emergency Commons debate on English Votes for English Laws was really rather alarming.\nThe debate, so skilfully secured by Lib Dem ex Scottish secretary Alistair Carmichael, produced a slightly pointless vote in which the Conservatives mostly abstained, but it brought all kinds of nasty tensions to the surface.\nConservative MPs are supposed to be signed up for EVEL under the terms of their manifesto, but there were clearly quite a few with doubts, some about the policy, many more about the process, which was Mr Carmichael's line of attack.\nRead the article in full\nHowever, the plans came under sustained attack from Labour, SNP and Lib Dems in an urgent debate, secured by former Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael.\nMPs are due to debate and vote on the government's plans next week but Mr Carmichael, the MP for Orkney and Shetland, said the plans required more detailed consideration, arguably through primary legislation.\nIf MPs representing constituencies in England had a \"veto\" on certain legislation, it would breach the longstanding principle that MPs, no matter who they represented, were \"all equal\".\n\"To go as far as the government wants to go in the timescale they want to go brings with it an attendant level of risk that I would consider to be irresponsible,\" he said.\n\"They are not entitled to use the UK Parliament as a proxy for an English Parliament.\"\nAssurances that the new system would be reviewed by MPs after a year were inadequate, he added, saying this would not be capable of \"putting a dangerous genie back in the bottle after it had been let out - we all know that is the political reality\".\nBut Commons Leader Chris Grayling said it was \"simply incorrect\" to claim some MPs would be prevented from debating and voting on certain legislation and would continue to exercise the same rights as they do now.\nPressed by Mr Miliband on \"what the meaning and definition\" of English-only legislation would be, Mr Grayling said it would be up to the Speaker to decide but he believed a \"simple test\" would be what things were devolved to Scotland.\nRequiring bills to have the support of a \"double majority\" of the whole of the Commons and those MPs representing England would also help mitigate \"any resentment\" felt by English voters about the slower pace of devolution to England.\n\"It is of vital importance that English citizens of the UK, as we move to an extra layer of devolution to Scotland and Wales and devolve additional tax powers to Northern Ireland, that they think it is fair,\" he said.\n\"It is what we pledged to do in our manifesto.

You have to stay, you have to have great dexterity, agility, balance and a turn of foot comes in very handy.\n\"It is a proper test of a horse - you wouldn't necessarily design it as a track for anything other than a rigorous test of a three-year-old in the first week of June, and that's what it is.\"\nGosden, whose ever-powerful string based at Newmarket is the biggest threat to the prevailing dominance of Ireland's Aidan O'Brien, should know.\nIt's 20 years since he saddled Benny The Dip to win, and two since he masterminded Golden Horn's big-race success with Frankie Dettori riding in the silks of owner-breeder Anthony Oppenheimer.\nGolden Horn, who by that point had won the regularly significant Dante Stakes at York, went on to stamp his authority on proceedings that season.\nAfter Epsom, he galloped off with the Eclipse Stakes, the Irish Champion Stakes and the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe before suffering one of just two defeats, at the Breeders' Cup fixture in Kentucky.\nCracksman represents the same owner-trainer-jockey combination, and comes to Epsom with two wins from two starts, the second at Epsom when narrowly beating fellow Derby hopeful - and this year's Dante winner - Permian.\n\"Cracksman is not a Golden Horn,\" Gosden told BBC Sport, \"but he's a superior horse to Benny The Dip.\n\"He's still learning a lot, and when he came here and won the trial he grew up overnight, so we're excited.\"\nBelieving there is no standout in this year's Derby, worth a total of nearly £1.625m - a record, Gosden fields three more runners than ever before.\nCracksman, who like fellow leading contender Eminent is a son of champion racehorse-turned-fledgling stallion Frankel, is joined by striking Goodwood winner Khalidi - added as a late entry, for £85,000 - plus three longer shots in Crowned Eagle, Glencadam Glory and Pealer.\nA multitude of runners under a single, or near-single, banner is something of a feature of the 2017 staging of the world's best-known flat racing prize.\nO'Brien - looking for a sixth win after Galileo, High Chaparral, Camelot, Ruler Of The World and Australia - saddles another formidable Coolmore-owned challenge.\nCliffs Of Moher, winner of the Dee Stakes at Chester, with Ryan Moore riding, leads six, ahead of well-supported Capri and Venice Beach. Douglas Macarthur, The Anvil - on which the trainer's apprentice jockey daughter Ana becomes the third female jockey to take part - and Wings Of Eagle make up the raiding party.\nO'Brien's son Joseph, the jockey on board when Camelot and Australia were victorious but now training, saddles Rekindling.\nVia his Godolphin operation and his son Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed, owner Sheikh Mohammed is represented by Permian, Lingfield Trial winner Best Solution, once-raced Dubai Thunder and Benbatl, the Dante Stakes runner-up.\nStrongly supported Eminent, sixth in the 2000 Guineas, trained by Martyn Meade and the mount of flat racing's champion jockey Jim Crowley, heads 'the rest'.\nIt does look genuinely wide open.\n\"We don't have any exceptional favourite standing out and frightening everyone away,\" said Gosden, whose father 'Towser' trained 1966 winner Charlottown as a two-year-old before ill health forced his own retirement.\n\"That's why we're winding up with a pretty big field. But I still think that the first three will be very, very good horses.\n\"The biggest problem is probably going to be for the jockeys getting around in a big field. You try riding around Epsom with so many other runners. It's not an easy job at all.\"\nFood for thought for apprentice jockey Paddy Pilley, who replaces Gina Mangan - barred from taking part on safety grounds - on 1,000-1 outsider Diore Lia.\nHowever, the presence of Diore Lia, the large field and the chance for Frankel to father a first European Classic winner gives the whole thing an intriguing narrative.\nIt'll take a lot more than a spin of a coin to sort out this one.",

In some cases, they are changing the voting habits of a lifetime.\nThe first switcher was just a few blocks from the Republican convention location. Tim - who didn't want to give his last name - is a lawyer who works in Cleveland's Key Tower, the tallest building between Chicago and Philadelphia. A lifelong Republican, he believes that Mr Trump is not just telling tall stories, but dangerous ones.\n\"I am very concerned about any leader who appeals to the worst instincts of human nature. That's very dangerous for the country and I love my country more than I love my party.\"\nSo will he vote for Hillary Clinton? \"I may. I haven't quite got there, but I definitely won't vote for Donald Trump. Anyone who knows me knows how ridiculous that sounds, that I would even think of voting for her.\"\nI heard a very different view in the run-down town of Warren, 50 miles east of Cleveland. At the 422 restaurant, the only place to eat on what local people say was once a bustling strip, I met a group of disillusioned Democrats. They used to work at the town's steel mill, which is now nothing more than a fenced-off patch of wasteland.\nAs jobs, opportunities and hopes have disappeared, so too has the loyalty they felt - or were encouraged to feel by the unions - towards the Democratic Party. During the 35 years that Joe Shrodek worked in the mill's blast furnace, he always voted for Democratic presidential candidates. But not this time.\n\"When I was there I voted Democrat the whole time, the unions endorsed [the candidate]. All that's gone now. I just want change, that's all. They need to clean house in Washington.\"\nSo, is Mr Trump the man to do that?\n\"I don't know,\" he says, \"but I'm voting for him.\"\nWatching Joe and his friends mop up the restaurant's roasted hot pepper dip with slices of white bread, local Republican Party chairman Randy Law predicts that Mr Trump will soak up the votes of many other white working class voters like them.\n\"I see it every day. People calling me, emailing me. There is this anti-Hillary feeling. People seeing it as a third term for Obama. People are fed up with a lot of those policies that have hurt big business, small business and trade and people are tired of being politically correct.\"\nCrossing the state line into Pennsylvania, another swing state, where polls suggest a tight contest, I encountered a different type of switcher. Judie Radel, who owns the Yee Haw farm in Duncannon, has always voted Democrat. She was a Bernie Sanders supporter in the primaries. Patting her \"girls\" - the milk cows she tends on the 160 acres she farms - she says that she's leaning Republican.\n\"I don't trust Hillary. We've had eight years of a Hillary administration and I think we need change.\"\nShe says that she enjoyed Mr Trump's speech at the Republican convention. \"I like that it was a doom and gloom speech that didn't sugar coat what's going down in our country. Our country's in dire straits right now. We need to wake up.\"\nShe expresses some misgivings about a Trump finger on the nuclear button, but doesn't think it disqualifies him from the White House.\nAn hour south-east of Yee Haw farm, in Pennsylvania's more affluent Lancaster County, Ann Womble is rather more concerned. She has been an active Republican Party member for 30 years and was a delegate to the 2012 convention in Tampa.\nBut the Trump takeover has led her to take a big decision - she's just cancelled her party membership. She dismisses comparisons between the reality TV star, Donald Trump, and the Hollywood actor, Ronald Reagan, who first attracted her to the party.\n\"Reagan's candidacy was a sunny, happy conservative insurgency into the Republican Party, because it was optimistic. Now, we're in the opposite place. Trump is attracting people to his candidacy for dark, gloomy and dangerous reasons.\n\"His view is of an autocratic, almost Third World leader. If he were actually president of the United States and tweeting these things that he tweets all hours of the day, saying these things to camera, it could be apocalyptic.\"\nBut, despite that assessment, Ann can't bring herself to vote for the Republican Party's bogeywoman, Mrs Clinton, in November. Although she'll support Republican candidates for Congress, she may not vote in the presidential election at all.\nAnd that represents one of the challenges for the Democratic Party.\nWhile disillusioned Democrats are embracing Mr Trump, disillusioned Republicans find it much harder to support his opponent. Mrs Clinton's convention may project a positive vision of America. But to really succeed it needs to address and counter the negative impression that many Americans have of her.",

In contrast, a group of disillusioned Democrats in Warren, Ohio, are switching from being lifelong Democrats because they feel that the party has abandoned them.

Not an unqualified one - there are some quibbles - but in all key respects, it grips, it stirs, it delights.\"\nCavendish praises the \"thrill-a-minute\" stage craft which sees pupils heading to Hogwarts, at the start of the play, change into school uniforms \"in the blink of an eye\" as they head to the infamous Platform 9Â¾ to make their way to school.\nThe Stage also gives a five-star review, with Mark Shenton describing Harry Potter and the Cursed Child - co-devised by Rowling, with director John Tiffany and playwright Jack Thorne - as a \"truly game-changing production and a thrilling theatrical endeavour\".\nIt is an \"entirely original\" piece of work, with \"Dickensian sweep and momentum to the storytelling\", writes Shenton, adding: \"It earns its place on the stage, feeling distinct from both the books and the screen adaptations.\n\"By turns playful and gripping, disturbing and detailed, poignant and powerful, it is superb family entertainment.\"\nShenton also praises \"the theatrical wizards who've created this stunningly-realised alternative universe deliver one coup de theatre after another\".\nIn a nod to the Kings Cross platform number, Ann Treneman gives the play four and three-quarters stars in The Times, saying the \"wizardry on display\" is \"out of this world\".\nShe says the plot is complex (\"there are mazes that are more straightforward\") but adds: \"It's a raunchless Game of Thrones with heart.

He argues Part One should be billed as a magic show, due to the effects used, also praising its moments of comedy.\nShepherd adds: \"It's quite apparent this isn't written to be either a book or a tie-in film; it's a spectacle for the theatre, one that is filled to the brim with fan service and magical imagery that will amaze.\"\nQuentin Letts grumbles about the length of the play in the Daily Mail, noting: \"There were moments I could have done with a glug of gurdyroot infusion to keep me alert.\"\nBut he admits: \"Potter addicts will love it. JK Rowling is going to make (another) fortune. The West End's ornate Palace Theatre, itself a little like Hogwarts, has a hit probably for years.\"\nVariety describes it as \"spellbinding\", Matt Trueman writing that it is: \"The Show That Lived Up to Expectations â€” and Then Some.\"\nHe says the relationship between Albus and Scorpius is \"the friendship of two bullied boys bound together, and it's a beautiful, tender thing\", adding: \"The script by Jack Thorne recognizes that rejection breeds resentment, and outsiders stew into outcasts.\n\"No one's born a villain, nor sees themselves as such, and where the books gave us stock baddies, Cursed Child fleshes them out.\"\nChris Jones, in the Chicago Tribune, says that \"heretical as this may sound\", the play left him \"quietly lamenting that the movies were ever made\".\nBen Brantley in the New York Times writes: \"Like the novels that preceded it, The Cursed Child is stuffed with arcana-filled plots that defy diagrams and baldly wrought sentimental life lessons, along with anguished dives into the earnest, tortured solipsism of adolescence.\n\"By rights, such a combination should try the patience of any grown-up.

Or would research rivals in Germany or China snap them up to the detriment of the UK economy?\nShowing how seriously they take this, Oxford University has appointed its own head of Brexit strategy.\nSo you could say that at least Brexit has already created one extra job.\nBut this new postholder, Professor Alistair Buchan, saw leaving the EU as threatening to relegate the UK's universities behind their global competition.\nOxford has been ranked as the world's top university, but Prof Buchan said that in 1970s the UK's universities did not have that top status.

Or would it mean that universities in the UK would have pay for scholarships rather than see them go elsewhere?\nCommittee chairman Neil Carmichael pushed his witnesses for more evidence and facts.\nBut what came back most often was even more questions. What's going to happen to the EU staff in UK universities? What will be the visa system for students?\nWhat will happen to the intricate networks of European research?

In conversations late last year, he was still exultant at his own role in triggering the invasion which unseated Saddam Hussein. For him, that was the overarching goal that justified any possible means.\nBut it was not just the removal of the dictator that plunged Iraq into the chaos which has continued to shake and fragment the country ever since.\nIn the months that followed, every political and security structure holding the country together was dismantled, including the all-pervasive Baath Party (a process in which Ahmed Chalabi played a role), the army and the intelligence services.\nThousands of highly experienced officers and officials from Saddam Hussein's minority Sunni community were sent home with a burning grudge, setting the scene for the subsequent Sunni-based insurgency, sectarian fragmentation and blood-letting, and the eventual emergence of IS.\nIS began in Iraq and later spread to Syria, where it could exploit the chaos and vacuums caused by the civil war to entrench and grow, eventually erupting back into Iraq with the storming of Mosul last year.\nNow it is firmly entrenched in both countries, and the prospects for pulling both of them back together as unitary states are daunting, given the degree of fragmentation in both.\nThat is the spectre haunting the West, as it ponders how to deal with a crisis that has sent millions of refugees into neighbouring countries, and hundreds of thousands flooding into Europe.\nDoing nothing may increasingly not be an option.

He reviewed the recent rapid progress in areas like self-driving cars and the triumph of Google's DeepMind in the game of Go - and predicted further advances.\n\"I believe there is no deep difference between what can be achieved by a biological brain and what can be achieved by a computer.  It therefore follows that computers can, in theory, emulate human intelligence â€” and exceed it.\"\nThat, he said, could lead to the eradication of disease and poverty and the conquest of climate change. But it could also bring us all sorts of things we didn't like - autonomous weapons, economic disruption  and machines that developed a will of their own, in conflict with humanity.\n\"In short, the rise of powerful AI will be either the best, or the worst thing, ever to happen to humanity.  We do not yet know which.\"\nSo, an easy enough mission for the Centre for the Study of Intelligence - just find out whether AI is going to kill us or not.\nActually the multi-disciplinary centre,  which brings together philosophers, psychologists, lawyers and computer scientists,  will have a rather more practical programme of research.\nLong before the robots decide whether we are surplus to requirements,  we are for instance going to need to think about issues such as whether autonomous vehicles should be programmed to protect pedestrians or passengers.\nAnother speaker at the event was Professor Maggie Boden, a major figure in artificial intelligence research for more than 50 years.\nShe told me she had long seen the need for the debate we are having now - but she was not worrying about our imminent extinction and was rather less convinced than Professor Hawking that we were heading into the AI future at breakneck speed.\nHer concern was about the impact of automation right now - in Japan at least - on elderly people.  She pointed to the enthusiasm for the use of robots in the care of the elderly and sick and said society would have to ask whether this was dehumanising. \"I'm scared of that,\" she said.\nAfter decades of research into AI,  Professor Boden still does not see robots replacing humans in functions which require empathy and emotional intelligence. Artificial intelligence could soon offer governments the chance to cut growing bills for social care - but at a cost for those in need of  help.\nJust one of the issues which will now be addressed by the Centre for the Future of Intelligence - and rather more urgent than the threat from some future Terminator.\nRead more of the BBC's AI coverage here.",
        "output": "In recent years, several prominent figures including Stephen Hawking, Elon Musk, Bill Gates, and Steve Wozniak have expressed concerns about the dangers of artificial intelligence (AI). However, Hawking's vision was the most apocalyptic, warning of robots deciding they no longer need humans. These prophets of AI doom aimed to encourage the world to think about the science and to involve more people in the debate. The Centre for the Future of Intelligence in Cambridge, which was launched on Wednesday, will study the implications of AI and its potential pitfalls. Hawking believes that computers can emulate human intelligence and potentially solve problems like disease, poverty, and climate change, but they could also bring autonomous weapons, economic disruption, and machines that develop conflicting interests with humanity. The centre will address practical issues such as programming autonomous vehicles to prioritize protecting pedestrians or passengers. Prof. Maggie Boden, a major figure in AI research for over 50 years, is less concerned about the imminent extinction of humans and more worried about the impact of automation on elderly people in Japan. She argues that society will have to ask whether using robots in the care of the elderly and sick is dehumanizing.",

We don't know whether they received any other support.\n\"In the last few weeks of the campaign we've been running, we've been inundated with calls from parents who're in that situation and their child has been rejected from receiving a CAMHS service.\n\"They haven't been signposted anywhere else - that's a very worrying picture.\"\nCaitlin Wyllie-Quinn, 20, a student from Irvine, had a difficult transition to secondary school.\nBullying left her isolated and very down, crying all the time.\nShe got some initial help from the local Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service but after leaving therapy she went downhill rapidly.\nHer GP made another referral to CAMHS but this time it was rejected. Caitlin was told that because she was not suicidal or self-harming, her case was not serious enough.\n\"If the person doing the assessment had asked me if I was suicidal or self-harming I would have answered yes to both those questions, but basically I was refused help because they didn't have the capability to assess me properly,\" she said.\n\"I was at a real low point and I felt that getting referred to CAMHS was some sort of light at the end of the tunnel and finally maybe getting some help.\n\"For that to be stripped away from me made me feel even more worthless and just made things so much worse for me.\"\nThe NHS in Scotland provides mental health services for children and young people with a wide range of mental health problems including anxiety, behaviour problems, depression and early onset psychosis.\nThe Scottish government's mental health strategy commits it to carrying out reviews into school counselling and rejected child and adolescent mental health service referrals.\nIts mental health minister, Maureen Watt, said the reviews would happen \"soon\", and would allow improvements to be made to the system.\nMs Anderson said this was encouraging, but added: \"We really urge that to be quick and thorough because there are young people waiting now to get help and support.\n\"It might be that the CAMHS service isn't appropriate for them, but we simply don't know what the problem is.\"\nMeanwhile, statistics published on Tuesday also showed that a waiting time target for people to receive specialist mental health treatment has again been missed.\nThe Scottish government has had a target in place since 2014 for 90% of patients to be seen within 18 weeks of referral for mental health support.\nBut the target has never been met nationally - with the latest figures showing that 83.6% of children and adolescents, and 73.7% of adults, were seen within the required timescale between January and March of this year.\nAt the end of March, there were 6,932 children and young people across Scotland waiting for help from CAMHS, up from 6,359 at the end of December, according to the NHS statistics.\nAt the same time, there were 20,952 adults waiting for treatment, compared to 20,195 in December.\nAverage waiting times varied dramatically across the country, with 10 NHS boards meeting the target for CAMHS treatment but only three health boards meeting it for adult psychological care.\nThe figures also showed that 74 children and young people starting their treatment had been waiting more than a year to be seen.\nNHS Grampian met the waiting time target for just 45.2% of young people, while in NHS Lothian the target was met for 47.8% of youngsters\nAnd in the NHS Forth Valley area, only 40% of adults starting psychological treatment between January and March were seen within 18 weeks, with an average wait of 25 weeks.\nA spokesman for the Scottish Children's Services Coalition (SCSC) said research has suggested 10% of children aged between five and 16 have a clinically diagnosable mental health problem.\nPointing to a \"clear postcode lottery\" when it comes to treatment, he added: \"We are deeply concerned about what is happening to the more than a fifth of children and young people not accepted for treatment.\n\"There is a need for an urgent inquiry to ascertain why these young people are being rejected for treatment and what is happening to them.\"\nMs Watt, the mental health minster, said the number of health boards which had met the waiting time target for young people had increased from seven to 10 since the end of 2016.\nShe added: \"However, I'm clear that we must continue to reduce waiting times and I will not be satisfied until our target is met sustainably.\n\"Our recently published 10-year strategy for mental health sets out a range of measures that focus on prevention and early intervention to meet the mental health needs of children and young people, backed by Â£150m of funding.\n\"We will also soon commission reviews into school counselling and rejected child and adolescent mental health service referrals, as a foundation for making further improvements.\"",

All the patients stayed on their usual medication.\nAs expected, those on just their usual medication declined over 48 weeks of treatment. But those given exenatide were stable.\nAnd three months after the experimental treatment stopped, those who had been taking exenatide were still better off.\nProf Foltynie told the BBC News website: \"This is the first clinical trial in actual patients with Parkinson's where there has been anything like this size of effect.\n\"It gives us confidence exenatide is not just masking symptoms, it's doing something to the underlying disease.\n\"We have to be excited and encouraged, but also cautious as we need to replicate these findings.\"\nThey also need to trial the drug for much longer periods of time.\nAn effective drug would need to hold back the disease for years in order to make a significant difference to patients.\nParkinson's progresses slowly and the difference in this 60-week trial was definitely there, but was \"trivial\" in terms of the impact on day-to-day life, say the researchers.\nThe drug helps control blood sugar levels in diabetes by acting on a hormone sensor called GLP-1.\nThose sensors are found in brain cells too. It is thought the drug makes those cells work more efficiently or helps them to survive.\nIt is why the drug is being tested in other neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's.\nDavid Dexter, the deputy director of research at Parkinson's UK, said: \"The findings offer hope that drugs like exenatide can slow the course of Parkinson's - â€Šsomething no current treatment can do.\n\"Because Parkinson's can progress quite gradually, this study was probably too small and short to tell us whether exenatide can halt the progression of the condition, but it's certainly encouraging and warrants further investigation.\"\nDr Brian Fiske, from the The Michael J Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research, said: \"The results from the exenatide studies justify continued testing, but clinicians and patients are urged not to add exenatide to their regimens until more is known about their safety and impact on Parkinson's.\"",

Additionally, three months after the experimental treatment stopped, those who had been taking exenatide were still better off.

It has grown into a complex ecosystem over hundreds of years with lots of specialist organisms feeding off each other.\nThe coral is home to plants and anemones which in turn are home to fish, and crustacea of dazzling variety.\nBankers and traders may be the apex predators but there are lawyers, accountants, insurance brokers and tech workers swimming around them.\nIt's very hard to replicate but that doesn't mean it can't be damaged. If you chip a bit off - you lose a few of the resident clownfish too.\nThat rather extended metaphor is perhaps one way to think about the subject of euro clearing. It's a very basic, boring and yet incredibly important bit of the reef.\nClearing is the process by which a third party organisation acts as an intermediary for both buyer and seller.\nThey deal with the clearing \"house\" rather than each other which centralises everything and makes the whole complex business easier and quicker. 75% of all everything bought and sold in euros - anywhere in the world - is cleared in London - some 850 billion euros EVERY DAY.\nClearing houses also bear the risks that once side of the transaction doesn't cough up.\nIn return for that risk, buyers and sellers have to keep money in a special account with the clearing house in case there are problems. The more business you do with them, the less money proportionately of your trading volumes you need to keep in that account. Bigger clearing houses are therefore cheaper for their customers.\nIf you start chipping bits off the reef and carting them off to Europe those costs could rise. Some estimates put the cost of fragmenting this bit of the reef at an additional 77bn euros to the people that use them.\nIt would cost UK jobs too. An Ernst and Young study last year estimated that over 80,000 UK jobs would go if euro-clearing moved from London.\nOther financial centres have tried for years to steal this business. In fact, the European Central Bank in Frankfurt tried to insist that all euro trades in the EU were done inside the eurozone. A policy it had to scrap when the European Court of Justice ruled in 2015 it discriminated against non-eurozone countries who are part of the EU.\nIf that court case is run again once the UK is outside the EU, that defence no longer works.\nThis new raiding party is led by the EU Financial Services Commissioner Valdis Dombrovkis who is arguing that either the EU has greater policing powers over clearing in London (a cup of cold sick in political and regulatory terms) or, the business has to relocate to the EU (two cups).\nIt's not clear, however, that a defeat for London would be a victory for the EU. Some euro clearing also happens in the US and many think that the way firms will minimise the cost of disruption and fragmentation will be to do their business in New York - another big reef - which would only serve to weaken Europe as a whole in the global financial power league.\nThat is what Chancellor Philip Hammond was getting at when he warned that the UK and Europe \"should be careful of any proposals which might disrupt growth, raise the cost of investment in Europe and the UK or weaken financial stability\".\nNew York is watching closely on the sidelines as the battle for Britain's finance industry starts in earnest.",

The relocation of this business would be expensive and could cost UK jobs, with some estimates putting the cost at an additional 77 billion euros. The EU Financial Services Commissioner is leading the charge for greater policing powers over clearing in London or for the business to be relocated to the EU, but it's not clear that this would be a victory for the EU.

There are two players that are assets in that team [Jordan Pickford and Jermain Defoe]. Other than that there's not too much in that squad that's worth a lot of money.\nMatch of the Day commentator John Motson:\nA club badly managed from above for the last four years. At least three managers have got them out of it at the end of the season.\nThe rot set in at Sunderland a long time ago and it came right from the top.\nI have no sympathy with them - they deserved to do down. I just hope somebody, whether it's David Moyes - a new owner perhaps - has got the opportunity to bring them back.\nThey have been a great club, they've got great fans but I'm afraid the way the club has been run, they've deserved what they got.\nFormer Premier League striker Jason Roberts:\nThose Sunderland fans are seeing a team and a club that I think has lacked leadership from the boardroom.\nThat's why they have skipped from manager to manager with no real plan or identity.\nMaybe they need to go down, refocus, bring in some young hungry players and give a new \"project\" to the Premier League because Sunderland are a huge club and if they come back up next season, they will be a club many will fear.",

At the moment not only do they earn more, they also get a proportionately bigger tax top-up from the government when they save for their retirement.\nIf the chancellor had scrapped the tax relief entirely on pensions savings and created instead a new pensions Isa, that would have cost the better off (40p and 45p taxpayers) billions of pounds collectively.\nThe other proposal which had been reported was to create a new pension tax relief rate of 25p or even 33p. That would have punished higher earners as well but not by as much as the Isa-style option.\nIt would also have encouraged saving for retirement by the less well off (20p taxpayers) by, in effect, giving a pound for every four they saved.\nMick McAteer, co-director of the Financial Inclusion Centre, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he was \"very disappointed\" that the government had stepped away from tackling the \"clear inequality in our pension system\".\nDot Gibson, general secretary of the National Pensioners Convention, Britain's biggest pensioner organisation, said: \"The chancellor has wasted a golden opportunity to not only reform the unfair system of pension tax relief, but at the same time solve the funding crisis in social care.\"\nConservative MP Mark Garnier, who sits on the Treasury select committee, acknowledged that the present system \"massively favours those people who are earning more money\" and told Today he favoured \"a fundamental rehash of the pension system\".\nHowever, he said a flat rate relief would have been \"quite difficult to administer\" and more thought should be given to what reforms would work best.\nMr McDonnell said the chancellor was \"putting the interests of his party ahead of those of our country\".\n\"The big test for this Budget is whether it can start to lay the secure foundations for the economy of the future. This decision suggests George Osborne is only interested in securing the future leadership of his party.\"\nFormer Liberal Democrat pensions minister Steve Webb, who now works in the pensions industry, said Mr Osborne had been right to resist changes.\nHe called for a \"period of stability\" in pensions policy in the interest of encouraging people to save for the long term.\nSavers pay no tax on money they put into a pension but they do pay tax on what they take out each year beyond the personal allowance.\nThe government also allows pensioners to withdraw 25% of their pot tax free as a lump sum.\nThe way the relief works is that some of a person's earnings that would have been taken by government in tax can be contributed to their pension instead.\nPension savers receive tax relief at the highest rate of income tax they pay.\nThis means that the cost of a £10,000 pension contribution would, in effect, be £8,000 for a basic rate taxpayer because otherwise £2,000 would have gone in tax. For a 40% taxpayer the saving would be £4,000, and £4,500 for those at the 45% rate. So present arrangements favour the better off.\nThe amount anyone can save into a pension and receive tax relief on is capped at £40,000 annually and £1.25m in their lifetime.\nMr Osborne was warned ahead of the Budget that introducing Isa-style arrangements could prompt a mass withdrawal from pension funds.\nConservative MPs had also become concerned about the impact on their constituents of any move to flat rate relief, which would have reduced breaks for higher rate taxpayers.\nBBC political correspondent Eleanor Garnier said Mr Osborne's decision was also a recognition of how fragile the EU referendum campaign is and removed the risk of upsetting voters ahead of the vote on 23 June.\nAn ally of the chancellor told the Times that Mr Osborne did not want to put people off saving. \"Now isn't the right time, with uncertainty in the global economy and reforms such as auto-enrolment still bedding in, to turn things on their head.\nThe prospect of radical reform had also been opposed by the pensions industry.\nChanges to the pensions system in recent years have included automatic enrolment into workplace pensions in 2012, and people aged 55 and over being allowed to take their retirement pots how they want rather than being required to buy an annuity retirement income - introduced in 2015.",

From within Europe, Romanian nationals were the biggest group referred.\nThere are an estimated 92 organised crime groups in the UK with known involvement in human trafficking, it said.\nAnd 142 defendants were charged with offences related to human trafficking in 2011/12.\nBy Philippa RoxbyHealth reporter, BBC News\nThe two potential victims of organ trafficking in the UK in 2011 are the first people identified as being forced into giving up their internal organs for transplant.\nBut it's still a small problem, with organ trafficking making up only 1% of all potential victims of trafficking last year, according to the Serious Organised Crime Association.\nCases of illegal organ trading are rare in the UK because of safeguards in place.\nThe Human Tissue Authority sees 1,200 cases a year of living organ donation - 95% involve kidneys and 5% liver lobes.\nThese cases include people making altruistic organ donations and those coming from abroad to donate organs to family members.\nThe HTA interviews all potential donors to make sure they are consenting freely and to ensure there is no reward or payment.\nThe process can take up to six months with the donor required to sign a form stating no coercion was involved.\nOnly when the HTA is satisfied would the operation be allowed to go ahead.\nAdvice is being drafted for NHS staff to help them identify potential cases of organ trafficking.\nThe report concluded intelligence sharing with international police forces was already \"proving effective\".\nImmigration minister Mark Harper said the results demonstrated UK professionals were getting better at \"spotting\" the crime due to \"cross-government\" cooperation.\n\"We're doing a better job of cracking down people involved in the vile trade,\" he told BBC Radio 5 Live.\nBut the number of those prosecuted was \"not enough,\" he said.\n\"One of the things we do is to prosecute people for the most serious offences we can, and sometimes that's not a trafficking offence.\"\nMr Harper also said agencies needed to \"make sure victims who are trafficked are treated as victims and not as offenders, which has happened in the past\".\nDr Aidan McQuade, director of Anti-Slavery International, said Mr Harper \"must face up to the fact\" that the problem was worsening \"because of fundamental policy failures\".\nHe said the government viewed the problem \"through the lens of immigration\" and had allowed rights for migrant workers to slip from \"best practice\".\n\"It would be helpful if the government appointed a national commissioner on trafficking to make sure policy on this issue was unimpeded by politics.\"\nThe report revealed thousands of \"front-line\" workers, including border staff, police and healthcare workers, have been trained to better identify, support and protect victims over the past two years.\nSome airlines, including Virgin Atlantic and Thomas Cook, are also training cabin crew to identify those who engaged in trafficking and their potential victims.\nAnd a 24-hour confidential line has been set up for crew to report concerns to border officials before a plane lands in the UK.",
        "output": "The UK government has reported a significant increase in the number of trafficking victims, with 946 reported in 2011, compared to 710 in 2010. Trafficking gangs in China, Vietnam, Nigeria, and Eastern Europe pose the biggest threat to the UK. Better co-ordination between government departments and with authorities abroad is seen as key to fighting human trafficking. However, anti-slavery groups have warned of government failures, with two potential victims of organ trafficking being identified in the UK in 2011. The report also revealed an increase in the number of children being forced into crime, including street begging. Over 100 cases of trafficking are dealt with by London police each year, with the majority involving 10-15 people. The report suggests that many victims are not aware they are being trafficked and are promised legitimate jobs before being exploited.",

That was so dumb,\" adding that she would \"never\" do it again.\nLady Gaga is no stranger to shocking the world with crazy outfits, and this one surely topped the list.\nIn 2010, the pop star accepted her video of the year award in a dress made from raw beef.\nThe dress was condemned by several animal rights groups but went on to be inducted in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2011.\nIn an  interview with American news anchor Anderson Cooper, Gaga explained that her dress was in protest against the US military's \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy, a rule that banned open homosexuality in the armed forces.\nBeyonce announced her pregnancy with Blue Ivy in the most Beyonce way ever.\nAfter delivering a killer performance of Love On Top, she unbuttoned her blazer, dropped her microphone on the floor (we're sure the sound engineers were big fans of that) and began rubbing her tummy.\nThe audience (and her fanbase) went suitably crazy.\nMadonna isn't a stranger to delivering crazy performances - from hanging on a crucifix to rocking up in a ball gown as a French royal, we've seen it all.\nAnd whilst her 1984 performance at the VMAs would be considered quite tame by today's standards, at the time it was pretty groundbreaking.\nFrom her wedding dress costume, to the massive cake she emerged from to her hip thrusting on stage, critics suggested Madonna had set the standard for other artists performing at the VMAs to match.\nBritney and VMA stunts go hand-in-hand, so it's perhaps unsurprising she features more on our list than anybody else.\nThe singer started her 2000 performance in a tuxedo whilst singing I Can't Get No (Satisfaction). All very formal and elegant.\nBut then the whole world watched Britney rip off her clothes to reveal a skin-tone, bedazzled body suit as she began to sing Oops... I Did It Again.\nCritics cited this moment as a turning point for Britney's career - between the song and the costume, she did a pretty good job of trying to shed that Mickey Mouse Club image and show the world she was growing up.\nOne of the most jaw dropping moments of VMA history was when Nicki Minaj called out Miley Cyrus.\nIt all started when the rapper criticised MTV for leaving Anaconda out of the video of the year category, implying that she would have been nominated if she was white.\nTaylor Swift took this as a jab directed at her and responded on Twitter, after which the two engaged in a war of words. And then Miley weighed in on the topic.\n\"What I read sounded very Nicki Minaj, which, if you know Nicki Minaj, is not too kind,\" Miley said.\n\"It's not very polite. I think there's a way you speak to people with openness and love. You don't have to start this pop star against pop star war.\"\nAs Nicki accepted her award on stage and handed back to Miley, who was hosting the ceremony, she said: \"And now, back to this [girl] that had a lot to say about me the other day in the press. Miley, what's good?\"\nNicki later explained to The New York Times Magazine: \"I saw [Miley] just looking at me, with her face screwed up, and I thought, 'What the...?'\"\n\"The fact that you feel upset about me speaking on something that affects black women makes me feel like you have some big balls.\"\nAnd while we're on the subject of Miley Cyrus...\nAfter finishing her performance of We Can't Stop in 2013, the singer was joined on stage by Robin Thicke and that's when things got a little... R-rated.\nAs Thicke began singing the controversial Blurred Lines, Cyrus began stroking him with a foam finger and doing her own interpretation of \"twerking\" in her latex beige bikini.\nAfter Twitter melted, the singer defended it and claimed that she wanted to make history (mission accomplished) - but now it seems she regrets it.\nNatia Kirkland - commonly known as Lil Mama - seemed to have got caught up in the moment when Jay-Z and Alicia Keys were performing their ode to New York, Empire State of Mind.\nAs the song came to a close, Kirkland who is also a native New Yorker, jumped on stage and posed next to the two superstars with Jay-Z trying his hardest to ignore her.\nIn the middle of performing a mash-up of hits in 2003, Madonna surprised the world by kissing Britney Spears onstage.\nAfter cutting to the confused look on Justin Timberlake's face, Madonna then kissed Christina Aguilera.\nAt a time where both Spears and Aguilera were still trying to shake off their innocent teen-idol images, the kiss was an unforgettable VMA moment.\nFollow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

You impose yourself upon rivals through physical dominance and force of personality.\nIn a sport like rugby union, where players have never been bigger, faster, or hit harder for longer, might is right like never before. Which makes the continual influence of Dan Carter not just illogical but something close to miraculous.\nOn Saturday evening in Lyon, Carter - the leading points scorer in Test history, reigning World Rugby player of the year, World Cup winner for a second time seven months ago - will, in characteristically undemonstrative fashion, lead Racing 92's charge as they take on Saracens in the Champions Cup final.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nThe All Blacks great is not only a physical throw-back in a game increasingly for the outsized and enormous. At 5ft 10in and 14 stone, the 34-year-old plays an old-fashioned way: finding space where others seek contact, appearing unhurried when fly-halves have never had less time, still managing to play on instinct when set moves and patterns are everywhere you look.\nIt's not that Carter doesn't do the nasty stuff. In Racing's semi-final win over Leicester Tigers he made 16 tackles.\nIt's how he does it. Whereas Jonny Wilkinson, the original big-hitting number 10, stopped opposition runners like a rogue flanker and brought gasps from the stands and lungs of the victim alike, Carter tackles like he does everything else - with economy rather than anger, with perfect yet undemonstrative technique, with efficiency over ostentation.\nCarter is not quite the player he was. The outside break and sudden acceleration that defined so many of his early masterclasses have quietly been lost to the years. It doesn't really matter. In his swansong he appears to worry less about what he lacks than utilise what he does.\nIf it wasn't the sort of thing that in his home town of Southbridge would trigger disbelief - expressed, because this is the South Island of New Zealand, by something as flamboyant as a raised eyebrow or muted cough - you'd say it was all rather Zen: the impossible calm in a sporting storm, the balance between self and team, equanimity in even the biggest occasions.\nThere is the ritual of his relentless kicking practice, whether at the posts that his father put up next to the family home or on the foreign fields of France; the meditation brought about by those repeated simple actions; the carefully constructed humility of an All Blacks environment where 100-cap heroes like Carter and retired captain Richie McCaw were expected to clean up the dressing room like backroom juniors.\nAnd it is all done in the most unobtrusive way. Wilkinson kicked from the tee with such exaggerated movements that half-cut punters in pubs could do impressions. Dan Biggar has his little soft-shoe shuffle, the 'Biggarena'. Owen Farrell, Carter's opposite number on Saturday, has the laser eyes and robotic head-turn.\nCarter? Even after so many penalties and conversions, it's still hard to remember exactly how he looks in sweet motion. The fact that he has been the same with ball in hand - perfectly timed passes or offloads, but all done in the most discreet and understated way - have sometimes made it hard for people to understand what has made him so special. He doesn't always stand out, so how can he be outstanding?\n\"He's fascinating,\" admits Ronan O'Gara, arguably Ireland's finest fly-half and now, in early retirement, assistant coach at Carter's Racing.\n\"He's just extremely humble, extremely respectful. He smiles, he always finds a way of getting the job done.\n\"He doesn't stress, he's always polite, he's a breath of fresh air. You can learn an awful lot by just watching him.\"\nCarter isn't the only sporting great who can appear to be operating in slow-motion and fast-forward at the same time, but he maintains that composure longer than most.\nTennis' Roger Federer at his best was both unhurried and unflustered, but at the moment of victory all that held-back emotion would come crashing out. In cricket, Chris Gayle remains expressionless when thrashing unfortunate bowlers for six after six, but will dance with his top off when victory has been won.\nLionel Messi, for all the gossamer touches with that left foot, is all beautiful bustle and obvious energy, Cristiano Ronaldo all strut and preen on the football pitch.\nEven Tiger Woods, who before his fall could hold his form and nerve in the final-round meltdown like no other golfer, would spit and cuss his way round the course when the mojo left his side.\nCarter, in the biggest moments he has faced, has looked as perturbed as if he were back at Christchurch Boys' High School, from the second Test against the Lions in 2005, when he turned in a performance that led to him being described as \"the perfect 10\", all the way through to last October's World Cup final.\nAgainst the Wallabies at Twickenham that day, there was a moment to epitomise so much of what had come before: the All Blacks suddenly under huge pressure, their 17-point lead cut to just four with 15 minutes to go.\nIn his first 110 Tests Carter had landed a total of just six drop-goals. A week after adding another to put away South Africa in the semi-finals, he took a pass flat with the defence charging, his feet and eyes set for the short pass to Sonny Bill Williams on his outside shoulder.\nForty metres out, the game's greatest prize in the balance, chaos all around. Not for Carter. Instead, a little pocket of space and tranquillity and time where no-one else could see it, a turn of the shoulders and hips, a perfect contact with his left boot to send the ball arcing between the sticks.\nWilkinson was also touched by Eastern philosophy, first by Buddhism as cruel injuries kept keeping him out, later by a Japanese school of thought called Kaizen.\nBecause of the man that Wilkinson is, that was more about a tortured form of self-improvement. \"You imagine being watched by a video 24/7 to help you get better each day and make good decisions,\" he has said.\nFor Farrell, who shares much of Wilkinson's dedication, Saturday is also about a particular kind of personal development.\nAfter his yellow card in the critical World Cup group match against Australia and the two-week ban for a dangerous tackle after Saracens' Champions Cup semi-final win over Wasps, he will be watching Carter not just to keep his influence in check but to learn from the old master too.\n\"It's just how calm he is, how much he is in control of what he does that stands out,\" the fiery Farrell says.\n\"Trying to be calmer on the pitch, it's definitely something I'm always trying to do. The more you're calm, the more you're in control and the more you're thinking about the right things.\"\nCarter in control. The career moves on, but the philosophy remains the same.\nFor the latest rugby union news follow @bbcrugbyunion on Twitter.",

Officers responded by firing water cannon and tear gas.\nThe clashes left at least 44 demonstrators and 30 police officers injured, officials said. Dozens of people were also injured on Saturday, when police fired rubber bullets.\nLike the issue of electricity in Iraq, the failure of a public utility in Lebanon - rubbish collection - has brought to a head simmering, chronic public indignation over a deadlocked political system riddled with corruption, inefficiency and sectarianism.\nAs the embattled Prime Minister Tammam Salam pointed out, it is this issue that threw the spotlight on the \"political rubbish\" that is the real problem - one that has paralysed his own cabinet and the twice-prorogued parliament from taking effective decisions on any issue.\nBehind the political stagnation is the unbending stand-off between the two major political blocs, divided primarily over attitudes to the Syrian regime - the Iranian-backed Hezbollah and its mainly Shia allies on one side, and the Saudi-backed, mainly Sunni pro-Western 14 March movement.\nMr Salam's warning of an imminent collapse should be a wake-up call to those blocs that it is time to collaborate on solutions, not least to the 15-month vacancy at the country's presidency.

He was completely at ease saluting families, kissing babies and tenderly embracing a young disabled man, as the Pope was driven in an open jeep around the packed square.\nPope Francis also speaks when he remains silent.\nPope Francis, formerly Buenos Aires Archbishop Jorge Mario Bergoglio, was elected on 13 March, becoming the first non-European pope for almost 1,300 years.\nHe replaced Benedict XVI, who held the office for eight years and became the first pontiff in more than 700 years to resign, saying he no longer had the physical strength to continue.\nIn his Urbi et Orbi (To the city and the world) speech, Pope Francis began with a simple \"Happy Easter!\"\nThe 76-year-old Pope, who has begun his tenure by emphasising humility, went on: \"Christ has risen! What a joy it is for me to announce this message... I would like it to go out to every house and every family, especially where the suffering is greatest, in hospitals, in prisons.\"\nLater in his speech, Pope Francis said: \"We ask the risen Jesus, who turns death into life, to change hatred into love, vengeance into forgiveness, war into peace.\"\nThe Pope then mentioned troubled regions of the world in turn.\nIn pictures: Easter festivities\n\"Peace for the Middle East, and particularly between Israelis and Palestinians, who struggle to find the road of agreement, that they may willingly and courageously resume negotiations to end a conflict that has lasted all too long.\n\"Peace in Iraq, that every act of violence may end, and above all for dear Syria, for its people torn by conflict and for the many refugees who await help and comfort.\"\nFor Africa, the Pope referred to Mali, Nigeria - \"where attacks sadly continue\" - the Democratic Republic of Congo and the Central African Republic.\nHe added: \"Peace in Asia, above all on the Korean peninsula: may disagreements be overcome and a  renewed spirit of reconciliation grow.\"\nProfile: Pope Francis\nPope Francis concluded by saying: \"Peace in the whole world, still divided by greed looking for easy gain, wounded by the selfishness which threatens human life and the family, selfishness that continues in human trafficking, the most extensive form of slavery in this 21st Century.\"\nBBC Rome correspondent, Alan Johnston, says the Pope has reinforced his image as a man of simple, down-to-earth tastes, not wearing the more ostentatious of papal costumes and, for the moment, not moving into the grandiose papal apartments.\nOne pilgrim in Rome on Sunday, Briton Tina Hughes, said that Francis represented a \"new beginning\".\n\"I think he brings something special.

Universities Wales has called for the current tuition fee grant to be replaced by a means-tested grant in its manifesto ahead of next year's Assembly elections.

The UK government has allowed institutions in England to raise their fees if they can demonstrate high-quality teaching, but this move could add costs to the tuition fee grant and become unsustainable. There have been concerns that universities in Wales are falling behind their English counterparts due to the current funding system, and a review of higher education funding and student finance arrangements in Wales is ongoing. The Welsh government has stated that its tuition fee policy is an investment in young people, and the results of the ongoing Diamond review will inform the next steps for higher education funding in Wales.",

Then assessments become more and more intimate as we go deeper into the courtship stages, and this is where kissing comes in.\n\"In choosing partners, we have to deal with the 'Jane Austen problem': How long do you wait for Mr Darcy to come along when you can't wait forever and there may be lots of you waiting just for him? At what point do you have to compromise for the curate?\"\nProf Dunbar said that Jane Austen, whose works of romantic fiction included Pride and Prejudice and Sense and Sensibility, realised that people were extremely good at assessing where they were in the \"mating market\" and pitching their demands accordingly.\n\"It depends what kind of poker hand you've been dealt.\n\"If you have a strong bidding hand, you can afford to be much more demanding and choosy when it comes to prospective mates,\" he said,\nIf kissing plays a part in selecting a partner then it also plays an important role before sex in short relationships and at a range of different times in committed relationships, the study found.\nThe study found that kissing was particularly important to women in long-term relationships.\nThis may be because it plays a role in increasing feelings of affection and attachment among couples, the researchers suggest.\nPrevious research had found that women placed greater value on activities that strengthen long-term relationships because being pregnant and raising children is easier when two parents are present.\nIn another study in Human Nature, researchers from Oxford suggest that women's attitude to romantic kissing also depends on where in their menstrual cycle and their relationship they are.\nWomen valued kissing most at the start of a relationship and around the time they were most likely to conceive in their cycle.",

Normally firms use an IPO as an opportunity to make lots of cash.\nIn general, IPOs can also cost a fair chunk of money, and, crucially for Spotify, they can take a lot of time to set up.\nAn IPO needs an investment bank or banks to underwrite an issue of new stock. Underwriting often amounts to the bank buying new stock to resell after the company floats.\nThe bank also looks at the company as part of the process for setting a reasonable initial offer price for the shares. The underwriters \"build a book\" - that is, they go to institutional investors to gauge the appetite for the shares in the company that's going to be floated. Fund managers say how many shares they want and the price they would be willing to pay, and the level of this demand is one of the factors used to set the initial offer price.\nAll of this to-ing and fro-ing eats up cash and time - and for Spotify, the clock is ticking.\nIn March last year, the firm raised $1bn from investors at an interest rate of 5% a year, plus a discount of 20% on shares once they list.\nBut under the terms of the agreement, the interest rate goes up by one percentage point and the discount by 2.5 percentage points every six months until the shares are listed.\nSo as time ticks by, Spotify has to pay more to its creditors, and give them more of a discount on shares.\nAs well as being a faster process, direct listing also means fewer regulatory hurdles, and it helps keeps expectations about share prices in check.\nSpotify, which last year issued a $1bn (Â£801m) convertible bond, was publicly valued at $8.5bn (Â£6.8bn) in 2015.\nThe Swedish firm was founded more than a decade ago and now has more than 50 million paying subscribers.\nThis week it also signed a new long-term licensing deal with Universal Music Group, the world's largest record label.\nSpotify includes TPG and Goldman Sachs among its major investors.",

However, a direct listing is very rare, and typically used by smaller companies. Spotify's decision to pursue this route suggests it is not expecting high levels of trading in its stock, and it could sidestep a surge in first-day trading that often takes place after an IPO, which can signal that a company undervalued its newly issued shares. While an IPO can cost a fair chunk of money and take time to set up, direct listing could help Spotify avoid diluting the value of its shares and keep expectations about share prices in check.",

        "output": "Joan Edwards left her estate to \"whichever government is in office at the date of my death for the government in their absolute discretion to use as they may think fit\" in her will, but this wording caused confusion. The executors interpreted it as a donation to the political party in power, and both the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats accepted the donation. However, the public outcry that followed caused both parties to quickly hand back the money to the Treasury. The wording of the will was ambiguous, and it may never be clear what Edwards' true intention was. In another case, an anonymous £500,000 legacy made to the government in 1928 to reduce the national debt to zero cannot be touched because the national debt stands at about £1.2 trillion. Strict rules governing the making and execution of wills mean that errors can be made easily which can invalidate it. The wording of a will can also be problematic, and it is important to carefully draft a will, as errors can lead to a costly legal battle. The court will endeavour to discover the intention of the deceased and consider the circumstances that surrounded them when they made their will to assist in arriving at their intention. Homemade wills should be carefully drafted and include substitute beneficiaries and avoid naming individuals by nickname or abbreviated name. Altering a will after it has been signed will usually mean the alterations will be invalid and can lead to conflict within the family which can end up in the courts. The wording of a will can also be problematic, and it is important to carefully draft a will to avoid confusion.

Of course, her backing of the Remain campaign is important. And it's certainly better for the prime minister and the Remain campaign to have her In, rather than Out.\nBut her qualified support suggests there are three, rather than two, positions at the top of the Conservative party - 'Remain', 'Leave', and perhaps now, 'Reluctant Remain'.\nIt was the Out campaign struggling to contain their internal differences. Tonight, it feels like cracks might appear on the other side too.\nRead more from Laura\nA Downing Street spokeswoman urged journalists not to \"overdo the differences\" between the prime minister and the home secretary on withdrawal from the ECHR.\nShe said Mr Cameron \"rules nothing out\" as he seeks reform of the convention, saying the home secretary had been \"setting out a clear distinction between the ECHR and the EU\".\nRegardless of the outcome of the 23 June EU referendum, Mrs May said she still believed the UK should leave the ECHR which she said \"adds nothing to our prosperity\".\nIt was the ECHR, not the EU, that was responsible for controversial human rights decision affecting the UK, she said.\nEarlier pro-Leave Justice Secretary Michael Gove  warned that five potential new members of the EU - Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia, Albania and Turkey - would result in millions more people having the right to move to the UK.\nMrs May said Albania, Serbia and Turkey had \"poor populations and serious problems with organised crime, corruption, and sometimes even terrorism\".\nShe added: \"We have to ask ourselves, is it really right that the EU should just continue to expand, conferring upon all new member states all the rights of membership?\"\nShe said the UK had \"forgotten how to lead\" in Europe and must re-assert itself to force change from within, adding that it could veto Turkey joining the EU.\nIn her speech - and during a question and answer session - Mrs May admitted that being in the EU made it harder to control the \"volume of immigration\". But she said the UK was able to control its border by blocking entry to terrorists.\nShe praised David Cameron's leadership in trying to seek a better deal for the UK, but said the UK's collective posture was too often to \"blame Europe\" for its problems and the UK \"has to have more confidence to get things done\" rather than \"shouting from the sidelines\".\nMrs May said the issue the British public faced on 23 June was how the UK \"maximised\" its \"prosperity, security, influence and sovereignty\".\nIn what she said was an analysis of \"the risks and opportunities\" of EU membership rather than an attack on Leave campaigners, she said the post-war order had seen the UK and other countries \"cede sovereignty in a controlled way\" by co-operating to prevent a greater loss of sovereignty through military conflict or economic decline.\nMrs May said the question was not whether the UK could \"survive\" outside the EU given that it was the world's fifth largest economy which had \"friendships and alliances across the world\" - but whether the UK was \"better off in or out\".\nWhile \"the sky would not fall\" in the event of Brexit, she said she had concluded it was a matter of \"hard-headed national interest\" to remain in, based on security, trade and prosperity.\nOn security, she said EU membership enabled the UK to access EU-wide information, such as criminal records, to allow the UK to turn away serious criminals and terrorists at the border, fast-track the extradition of offenders and simplify the deportation of prisoners.\nThe UK had extensive intelligence-sharing with the US and other allies outside the EU, she said but being excluded from the EU-wide information sharing would make the UK \"less safe\".\nHowever, she called for major changes to the way the UK did business in the EU, including reducing the power of the European Parliament and the European Court of Justice.\nMr Duncan Smith told the BBC the home secretary's comments on the ECHR and EU expansion had \"thrown the gauntlet down\" to the government.\nOn EU expansion, he claimed, the prime minister is \"in favour of extending our borders to Syria\" by allowing Turkey to join the EU.\n\"She actually basically questions the very campaign she says that she supports,\" he said.\n\"This is a remarkable intervention. She has really thrown the gauntlet down and undermines the whole of the 'vote stay in' campaign.\"\nMr Duncan Smith said immigration was \"out of control\" and free movement of people rules meant the UK had to accept criminals coming into the country.\n\"An elected government in the UK elected on a platform to reduce immigration right now cannot deliver that because the EU is an open border,\" he told Radio 4's Today.\n\"You cannot reject anyone unless you can demonstrate categorically that they pose an immediate threat to the life and livelihood of the UK.\"",

My friends have been proud of me and enjoyed watching me. Now it's back to blazers and ties.\n\"No-one likes school really.

I made a right nice bride!\nThat sense of romance permeates your new album.\nOh yes!

And it's amazing. I've always been amazed by that myself, how people can just write, year in and year out, about love and it all is different. I could write one right now!\nHow often do you write?\nI write something almost every single day unless I'm sick or on a movie set.\nIs that ever an inconvenience?

If my cooking's really good that day, my songs are really good.\nIn Head Over High Heels, you sing about \"painting my eyes like Adele.\" What made you write about her?\nEveryone loves Adele.

And all of a sudden it's like, \"And my eyes like Adele!\"\nWhat do you think her reaction will be?\nI think she'll have to be complimented, just like I'm always complimented when people write songs about me!\nI just meant I wanted to look like Adele. I hope she thinks it's cute.\nYou both like to talk to your audience in between songs, but she swears a lot more than youâ€¦ I wondered what you made of that?\nOh, I don't pay any attention to that! Words are just an exchange, like money. I don't think the Lord holds that against us. I think that's just the way we communicate. And some people are just born cussers.\nWhat's the worst thing you've ever said on stage?\nOh, I've never said anything real bad. I try to respect the audience.\nThe song I'm 16 is based on one of your sisters, is that right?\nYeah, she had a couple of bad relationships and she thought it wasn't meant for her to have true love. Then all of a sudden, in her 60s, she met someone and they fell in love, and it's just like they were born again. It's just the sweetest thing.\nAnother one of my sisters and I were laughing. We said, \"Look at her, she thinks she's 16!\" and all of a sudden I heard the song in my head.\nGoes to show you're never old unless you choose to be.\nWhat age do you think of yourself as?\nI'm 16 in some ways. I'm still a hopeless romantic! But I'm 35 in my spirit and in my mind. When I was 35, it was a pinnacle, a great time in my life - success and happiness and all that. And so I just decided \"I'm gonna claim that number and always be that in my state of mind.\"\nWhat inspired Can't Be That Wrong?\nThat was an easy one to write. I think it's the ultimate cheating song.\nI based it on someone very, very close to me, who was very much in love with the person at home, and their children, and they weren't looking for love, they just happened to fall for someone. They were so torn, because they loved both people. I saw the turmoil and the heartache, and how overwhelming and overpowering it was. And I just thought, \"That's a strong-ass love, right there\". You know, to be willing to go through all you have to, and put the other people through that. So I thought, \"wow, this would make a great song.\"\nThe last time I saw you on stage in the UK was at Glastonbury - and you've put that concert on this album as a bonus disc. What are your memories of it?\nThat'll be one of my greatest memories, actually. That'll be a real highlight in my career.\nI wasn't even certain about doing that show, because I didn't know if I was the type of artist that would fit in that type of a festival - because people are rowdy, they like to go dancing, and they like to drink and smoke and I thought, \"I wonder if they're even going to pay attention?\"\nAnd so, as soon as I went out and I saw the crowd and heard the roar, I thought, \"Ohhhh, my Lord, how did I miss this all these years?\"\nThey call that part of the day the \"legends slot\". If you were booking next year's Glastonbury, who would you put in there?\nI don't know. I hadn't even thought about it in those terms. Probably Adele.\nBut I'm not sure I'd do it again, because I don't know how I could ever top that.\nPure and Simple is out now on RCA Records.\nFollow us on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, on Instagram at bbcnewsents, or email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk.",

He can be obscene at times but it is in Australia's more rough and tumble tradition,\" explained Dr Peter Chen, senior lecturer in the department of government and international relations at the University of Sydney.\n\"He originally was a member of the Labor Party. He joined the Liberal Party and he fell out with both sides of politics, most recently with his membership of the Liberal Party over the introduction of gun laws in Australia following the Port Arthur shooting about 20 years ago,\" Dr Chen added.\nSenator Leyonhjelm is broadly in favour of immigration, supports same-sex marriage, lower taxes and assisted suicide, but it's restrictions on firearms that make his blood boil.\n\"I find that distressing because it is wrong and it is very unkind to me and 800,000 licensed shooters in the country, who are absolutely vilified, treated like we are criminals-in-waiting and whose sporting implements are constantly under threat,\" he explained.\nHis critics argue that his stance on guns ignores the opinions of most Australians, who back tough laws.\n\"He is using extreme tactics to push through his quite dangerous agenda,\" said fellow New South Wales Senator Lee Rhiannon, from the Greens, who is her party's gun control spokesperson. \"He has been provocative, blunt, extreme, at times rude.\"\nShe concedes, however, that Senator Leyonhjelm and Pauline Hanson's right-wing anti-immigration One Nation Party are tapping into anti-establishment rage in Australia.\n\"We're seeing a real anger build up within the community with regard to machine politics, the political class, whatever name you want to call it, who are worried how their kids are going to buy a home and feeling left out of how society is working,\" Ms Rhiannon told the BBC.\n\"They think that globalisation has robbed them of a life that they think is fair.\"\nThe Liberal Democrats say they have recruited hundreds of disaffected former supporters of the governing Liberal Party and hope to mount a show of force at the next year's state election in Western Australia.\nThat campaign promises to be anything but dull.

These ejecta strings form radial patterns that can be traced back to an obvious source.\nThe chains Rothery and Fegan are attempting to distinguish, on the other hand, have no clear origin. They appear isolated.\nAnd, intriguingly, when they plot the orientation of these suspect catenae, they appear to betray a bias. More seem to point north-south than east-west. If confirmed, this may say something about the early population of comets in the Solar System.\n\"It could be that we're seeing the north-south ones more easily because of the direction of sunlight, but these are pretty big features - kind of hard to miss,\" explained Prof Rothery.\n\"If there are genuinely more catenae orientated north-south than east-west, it's suggesting that if they're produced by tidally disrupted comets then the comets that were hitting Mercury more than three billion years ago had orbits tilted at more or less ninety degrees to the plane of Mercury's orbit.\"\nThe idea is somewhat speculative at the moment, but fascinating nonetheless.\nAlthough the image stream from Messenger is about to end, the next probe to Mercury is already under construction.\nBepiColombo is a joint venture between the European and Japanese space agencies.\nIts mission will launch in 2017 and arrive in orbit in 2024.

The initiative has also helped the co-operatives produce Fairtrade certified cocoa beans. The cocoa crop was introduced to the island in the 19th century and was once the primary export, but declined in the late 1990s due to a crash in the commodity price. Ifad commissioned a French organic chocolate producer to assess the industry and found that organic cocoa could improve the price of the crop. The farmers have transformed their fortunes by coming together in co-operatives and processing their cocoa.

That is the rallying cry of the French National Front (FN) and some other populist parties.\nMigration and terrorism are also treated as separate issues because - as pointed out by EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker - many asylum-seekers are themselves fleeing from the terror inflicted by Islamic State (IS), the Taliban and other extremist groups.\nThe dilemma for the EU is that Schengen - the passport-free area embracing 26 countries - greatly eases the flow of people and goods across the EU, but also requires more information-sharing, to prevent cross-border criminality.\nAbout 1.7 million EU citizens cross borders daily in the Schengen zone to go to work, the Bruegel think-tank reports.\nAnd opinion polls indicate that many Europeans value Schengen more than any other change brought about by the EU.\nBut temporary border controls have been reimposed - by France, Germany, Austria and Hungary.\nSo the stakes are high at this summit.\n\"Our goal is clear: we must regain control over our external borders to stem migratory flows and to preserve Schengen,\" said Mr Tusk in his summit invitation letter.\nMr Juncker said Europeans now have \"one border\" and \"a shared responsibility to protect it\".\n\"We want to defend everything Schengen represents, and let me tell you that Schengen is here to stay,\" he told the European Parliament.\nSaving Schengen means beefing up the surveillance of all people entering or leaving the Schengen area.\nSo in future EU citizens, as well as those from outside the bloc, will have their passports checked against police databases.\nThere is much work to do, however, to link up and improve those databases.\nMore than a million refugees and other migrants have surged into the EU this year, most of them desperate to reach Germany or other northern countries where job prospects are better, or where relatives can help them settle.\nThe Syrian war has pushed irregular migration to the EU to a record high.\nThere are fears that the international campaign to smash IS, and the Russian bombing in support of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's forces, will drive even more Syrians to flee abroad.\nSo the 28 leaders in Brussels will look again at the EU's help for Greece and Turkey. The migrant registration process is still slow and patchy.\nTurkey, struggling with more than two million Syrian refugees, now has much bargaining power. Critics say the EU risks compromising its human rights standards as it leans on Turkey to curb the migrant flow.\nGreek coastguards and the EU's Frontex border agency only manage to intercept 20% of the migrants who reach Greek islands after life-threatening voyages, according to Frontex.\nThis week the Commission unveiled an ambitious plan for a new EU Border and Coast Guard to tackle problems on the EU's external borders.\nThe force - stronger than Frontex - would have 1,000 permanent staff and 1,500 reserves, who could be deployed rapidly to a trouble spot, within three days.\nThat could happen even without the host country requesting it - if the rest of the EU decides to take action.\nSuch force majeure might be the exception - but Poland has already raised objections on sovereignty grounds.\nOnce again, the migrant crisis is threatening to divide, more than unite, Europe.",

The temporary border controls reimposed by France, Germany, Austria, and Hungary indicate the stakes at this summit, as the EU seeks to regain control over its external borders and preserve Schengen.

We want asset managers to ensure investors receive value for money through pursuing energetically their duty to act in their customers' best interests.\"\nHe ruled out a price cap, which he argued would not encourage competition.\nSome investors have been critical of the sector for years, owing to the complicated structure of fees that can include charges for performance and transactions.\nThere was criticism in the report of \"actively-managed funds\" when a fund manager is paid to research the market. The extra cost to investors of this service were, on average, \"not justified by higher returns\", it said.\nThe FCA is proposing an all-in fee among other measures to help investors decide which fund is the best for them.\nIt also wants a more standard set of information across the sector making costs and charges clear.\nThe potential benefits of UK pension funds pooling their assets to gain better returns should also be explored, the FCA said.\nThe Investment Association, the trade body that represents UK investment managers, said that it had already been improving the transparency of costs.\n\"The investment management industry is committed to serving the needs of the UK's savers and investors and so we support the FCA's objectives to ensure that competition in the industry works to the benefit of its customers, whether individuals, families or institutions,\" said Chris Cummings, the association's chief executive.\n\"Over the coming weeks, we will engage closely with the FCA to understand its findings and the full implications of potential remedies.\"\nThe interim report now goes to consultation. The FCA said action could be announced next summer.\nOne of the City's most lucrative gravy trains is running out of steam.\nFund managers occupy a cosy world in which they have plenty of wiggle room on charges, make high profits and pick up tasty bonuses.\nThe FCA's solution is to have one easily-comparable charge and make value for money a priority. It might even ask the government to impose a statutory duty of care.\nBut the question which really stands out from this investigation is whether active fund management is really worth it. That's when managers pick the stocks they think will succeed.\nThe FCA found that investors in a passive fund which just tracks the market could earn a 44% higher return over 20 years, because of lower charges.\nMost investors would forgive even a sizeable charge if they had something to show for it.",

How many students are going to university? And what happens next for those still with big decisions to make?\nMAKING THE GRADE\nA new top grade, A*, was introduced in 2010. A total of 6.6% achieved this in 2016, a fall on last year and still short of the UK average of 8.1%.\nThe proportion of students getting A* and A also fell again from 23.1% to 22.7% and Wales continues to trail the rest of the UK and all regions of England apart from the North East of England.\nWhen you look at individual subjects, more students in Wales have been getting top grades in maths over the last five years than in England - but in English language, Wales has been trailing, with the gap still 3.2% in the latest set of results.\nIn French, 31% got A* to A in Wales - this is an improvement, but 37.8% managed that in England. The gap was as wide as 14% in 2012. Numbers of students taking French have also gone down by 11% this year.\nWales and England are a little further apart now at the top grades for A-level physics, with Wales dropping back to 25.8% behind England on 29.6%.\nIt is worth looking too at how many students are only getting the lower grades.\nA slightly higher proportion in Wales - 23.5% - got D and E grades, compared to 20.6% in England. That gap has also widened slightly too.\nWales has more students getting these lower grades in English (23.2%) than who managed A* to A (15.9%) in the same subject.\nThere is also a more students getting D and E grades in French in Wales than in England for most of the last six years.\nDavid Evans, secretary of NUT Wales, said A-levels were the first time students specialised in subjects and it was important the quality of education and teaching was there.\n\"We need to look at the numbers who get  A* and celebrate them, and those who get As, Bs and Cs too,\" he said.\n\"We need to make sure we have a clear focus on those who achieve the grades they need for university and makes sure support is there for those who go on to do other things as well.\"\nOn the question of whether A-levels are getting easier, Phil McTague, head teacher of Ysgol Eirias in Colwyn Bay said: \"If Usain Bolt sets a new record in the hundred metres, people don't say the hundred metres is getting easier!  Our students have worked really hard this year and we're proud of all their results.\"\nHOW DOES WALES COMPARE WITH ENGLISH REGIONS?\nFor the first time last year, we were able to compare Wales' results with regions of England on the day they were published.\nWales has the lowest percentage of A*-C grades of any area - 73.8- including every English region.\nIt also has the lowest for A* and A - apart from the North East of England, which is now lower than Wales.\nWHAT IS THE PERFORMANCE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN BOYS AND GIRLS?\nGirls continue to outperform boys overall in Wales, with 97.9% of entries by girls this year gaining A* to E grades, compared to 96.5% of boys.\nAt the A* grade, the performance of boys was marginally better than that of girls, with 6.7% of boys and 6.5% of girls gaining A* - both improving since 2013.\nYou can also see performance differences between boys and girls for the top grades within subjects - as well as a difference in subjects chosen. The likes of physics and computing are very male dominated compared to French, English and Welsh at the other end of the scale.\nGareth Pierce, chief executive of the WJEC exam board, said some of the patterns were long standing \"and a natural feature\".\nWhy do more girls go to university?\nHOW MANY STUDENTS APPLY FROM WALES?\nThere were 23,740 students from Wales applying to universities in the UK this year - and with many looking at more than one university, this meant a total of 40,010 applications to Ucas.\nThere is very little difference in the number of students from Wales applying to university over the last few years.\nMore than half a million students got higher education places in the UK last year - three quarters of those who applied. These included 20,500 students from Wales, a 1.7% rise and a new high, while 87.5% of 18-year-olds from Wales who applied got places.\nOf those 18-year-old students who applied to Welsh universities, 84% got an offer, while 75% of Welsh applicants to English universities got an offer.\nAlthough there is a lot of attention at schools on results day - only around half of those entering university are 18-year-olds; others take gap years while the number of students over 26 is rising again.\nBy the end of Thursday, Ucas said 17,510 students from Wales had places in higher education - more than at the same time over the last five years.\nSTILL, MORE 18-YEAR-OLDS ARE GOING TO UNIVERSITY\nWales recorded its highest entry rate - 28.2% of all 18-year-olds got higher education places through Ucas in 2015 - although that is behind England on 31.3%.\nWales has had one of the lowest proportional increases of UK nations and regions since 2006 - 13%.\nWHERE YOU LIVE CAN BE A FACTOR\nFewer pupils from poorer parts of Wales get to university.\nEntry rates are broken down across the UK into constituencies and analysis shows they are lower in more disadvantaged areas.\nIn Wales, the entry rate range is from just under 18% of 18-year-olds in Aberavon, to just over 48% in Cardiff North.\nFor those in the most disadvantaged districts in Wales the average rate is 16.6%, almost the same as the year before.\nBut compared with entry rates five years ago, 18-year-olds from disadvantaged areas in Wales were 23% more likely to be accepted for entry in 2015 - in England they were 30% more likely.\nMeanwhile, students living in what are classed as the most advantaged areas of Wales are five-and-a-half times more likely to go to a university with higher entry requirements than those from the most disadvantaged parts.\nLeading academic Prof Sir Deian Hopkin said the numbers from poorer backgrounds getting to university were still disappointing despite efforts.\n\"One of the great challenges in higher education is to attract students from less-affluent backgrounds because. very often, they come from an education system which doesn't encourage them to come to university in the first place,\" he said.\n\"Now a lot has been done over the years, there has been a big improvement, but the proportion has not grown at the same rate as the total increase in students in higher education. Therefore the challenge remains.\"\nProf Hopkin added: \"The disappointment in England is that the grant which supported many students has been abolished.\n\"In Wales, at least that has been maintained for now, but we need to see far more effort being put into encouraging, supporting and, indeed, mentoring students from backgrounds where these things are not natural.\"\nWHERE DO STUDENTS AT WELSH UNIVERSITIES COME FROM?\nAltogether, 77,750 students have already applied to Welsh universities - 18,450 from within Wales.\nThe chart shows where the others come from - more than half of them from England.\nUNCONDITIONAL OFFERS ON THE RISE\nThere has been a rise in students receiving unconditional offers from universities - which will have relieved the exam pressure a little for some. Across the UK, offers were made to 23,400 students in 2015,  compared to only 3,000 two years before.\nThis is around 2.5% of applications and involves 36 institutions, but there is no breakdown of how many are from Wales.\nCardiff and Swansea universities only made unconditional offers to students who are pre-qualified. This amounted to 1,200 for Cardiff this year.\nAberystwyth University said it made offers based on performance in its own scholarship exam, while Bangor University said it made unconditional offers to some of the most promising students, but they were looking \"at the whole package\" before deciding where to go.\nCLEARING: NO LONGER A LAST RESORT\nAround 4,100 students from Wales were looking for places on results day through the clearing system, which is a lower number than the last five years.\nA total of 300 students from Wales were given places on the first day, according to Ucas.\nClearing has become more of an accepted way in, no longer something to be embarrassed about for not getting the right grades.\nUcas says clearing has \"transformed into a respected and important route\" into higher education.\nAll Welsh universities are promoting their clearing services heavily, promoting many courses across the board.\nCardiff University had around 400 places available through clearing.\nBangor University said it was \"no longer seen or used as an opportunity of last resort\" and said it was seeing more students waiting to get their results before applying.\nDavid Moyle, Aberystwyth University's schools and colleges liaison manager, said there was no longer a stigma attached to clearing.\nThe university took 1,000 calls last year and was offering \"a limited number of places\" across 315 courses, with demand expected to be high in science and computing.\nThe aim is to ensure students \"get the best advice to make an informed decision\", said Mr Moyle.\nBack in 2013, Ben Grantham's A-level results were better than he expected and he was on the phone within an hour to clearing to get a place studying media and communication.\n\"With a process such as clearing it's important to act fast,\" said Ben, who recently graduated with first class honours.\n\"Hundreds of students will be in a position where they wish to apply for a course immediately following their results, and places are often limited and can fill up fast.\"\nJoanna Harris, of Careers Wales, said clearing could sometimes be a blessing in disguise to give students a chance to reflect and warned against making rushed decisions.\n\"Take a breath, do your research, look at the Ucas website for what's available or even ring the university you wanted to go to to see if they might still accept you first.,\" she said.\n\"There is often more than one university in towns and cities - don't make a rash decision, it's important, with the amount of money it will cost you, that you make the choice of course that's right for you.\"\nCLEARING DETAILS\nOTHER ROUTES\nOnly two thirds of 18-year-olds who left school last year went on to university, according to research by Careers Wales.\nWHAT IF I DON'T GET THE RIGHT GRADES?\nKerry Ann Wallace, 20, from Newbridge, Caerphilly, was upset after failing to get the right grades to study psychology last year but was in touch with a careers adviser.\nIt led her to a youth work apprenticeship at Torfaen council and she has ambitions to be a family support worker.\n\"I haven't looked back and it's great to be earning money while I learn,\" she said.\n\"If you're disappointed this week please go and talk to someone as I did, look online for things and don't be upset - find something you love.\"\nCareer adviser Joanna Harris, of Careers Wales, said it was important to take stock and look at options - but volunteering, an internship or part-time work can be useful additions to CVs ahead of the next step.\nSome will retake exams but there are also useful websites, such as notgoingtouni, which can point students on the career path, including apprenticeships.\n\"There's a choice,\" said Ms Harris. \"Just because you didn't get into Cardiff University, say, there might be a course somewhere else, there are foundation degrees and feeder degrees.\n\"If you're struggling, book an appointment with us or call us.\"",

Based on chances they deserved to win, but there was  big moment that didn't go our way, and who knows what might have happened.\"\nFormer England midfielder Jermaine Jenas: \"I don't think Swansea should have had a penalty as the distance from Gylfi Sigurdsson to Cesar Azpilicueta is too close and Azpilicueta's arm is already out. His hand is there because he's trying to stop Sigurdsson's run.\"\nEx-England captain Alan Shearer: \"I think it was a penalty. I think it was a deliberate movement of his hand towards the ball and I think Chelsea got away with one there. It could have been very different if the ref had given it.\n\"We've seen in recent weeks with Swansea that they made it very difficult for Liverpool at Anfield, they were unlucky to lose at Manchester City. They are very organised. The difference between Liverpool and City with this Chelsea side is the pace with which they go forward. That's why Cesc Fabregas was in the team today. He was brilliant. He's the one that started the goal off.\n\"It's topical that players are not working for mangers. The irony is last season we were sat here with a large bunch of these same Chelsea players - they weren't working for their manager and we know what happened. It's such a transformation now. We saw how brilliant they were with the ball but look at them now without it.

We are heartbroken,\" he said.\nHe spoke on behalf of the Dallas Police Department, but his words echoed a personal statement he made six years earlier, in the wake of another Dallas police death.\nIn June 2010, just weeks after he was sworn in as police chief, a young Dallas officer and father was shot dead on father's day.

Three years later, his younger brother was shot dead by a drug dealer.\nBut Mr Brown returned to work, determined to improve the Dallas Police Department's relations with the community. The department began to focus on de-escalation rather than force.

It's sacrifice, and it's sacrifice at the highest level.\"\nDallas Police Department equalled that 12-year sacrifice in a few short hours on Thursday. On Friday, Mr Brown reiterated his plea for mutual respect.\n\"There are no words to describe the atrocity that occurred to our city,\" he said. \"All I know is that this: This must stop, this divisiveness between our police and our citizens.\"",

He does not normally like being in areas of the pitch where he cannot affect the game in a positive way.\nBut obviously he was asked to play a different role by Sunderland manager Dick Advocaat because of their circumstances and he did a brilliant job for the team.\nI have never seen Defoe work as hard as he did to contribute defensively on Sunday - he tracked back on the left too and at one point he was making sliding tackles near his own corner flag, which was a first.\nHe is 32 now and he will not want to be doing that permanently. But knowing him like I do, if he is asked to do any kind of job for his team to help them stay in the Premier League then he will always give it his all.\nI do not think playing him there gets the best out of him, but it worked for Sunderland on Sunday.\nUltimately, Defoe only had one shot at goal in his 80 minutes on the pitch, but it was a world-class finish to win Sunderland the game and three vital points.\nThat is what they signed him for, and you could see from his celebration how much it meant to him.\nI have played in midfield behind Defoe and he is a very special talent in that he does not solely rely on through-balls.\nIf you get the ball to his feet, he has got the capability around the box to beat people himself and shoot from range with real power.\nDefoe has pace and thrives on being put through too of course, but one of the reasons he has scored as many goals as he has done in his career is that there are so many different elements to his game.\nYes he will get in the six-yard box to score you a tap-in but he can create goals for himself and, as Newcastle found out, score from distance as well.\nBefore that goal, he had not scored for six games which will have been hurting him because he is not used to it.\nBut I know that it will not have knocked his confidence because he is the sort of player that never loses faith in himself, and for good reason.\nThat bit of class he produced against Newcastle was the kind of moment of brilliance I have come to expect from him after playing with and against him down the years.\nDefoe's appetite was typical of the rest of the Sunderland team.\nWhat Dick Advocaat's side lack in quality, they make up for in physicality and endeavour which is a massive positive for them.\nThey have got some powerful players and they look fit, which is an often overlooked factor at this stage of the season.\nAgainst Newcastle, both of their full-backs - Billy Jones and Patrick van Aanholt - did brilliantly, flying up the wings.\nThey also have a few clever players, like Jordi Gomez and Seb Larsson, who have been in this position at the bottom of the table before and will be used to the pressure involved when you are fighting relegation.\nFrom what I saw of them in this game, they have got enough about them to beat the drop.\nBut that is mainly because of the quality Defoe gives them in the final third. He could be the difference between them staying up, or not.\nDanny Murphy was speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.",

Murphy played with Defoe in midfield and knows his versatility, with the ability to create and score goals from different areas of the pitch.

The pollution swathes the city, wreathing everything in grey.\nTo get a sense of it, take a look at this slideshow of before and after pictures that give a sense of what China's toxic sky is really like.\nA combination of coal emissions, dirty diesel and industrial gases, the smog has smothered everything for days. On Thursday, levels still hovered around the \"very unhealthy\" mark.\nAs the official Xinhua news agency reported, more flights were delayed at Tianjin close to Beijing. Visibility in Shandong province south of Beijing was just 50m (164ft).\nOn Thursday, too, there were reported to be more than 100 cars in crashes in Beijing. The roads were icy and slippery, but poor visibility cannot have helped.\nWhat were billed as \"tough\" measures brought in by Beijing's government this week to try to improve things simply have not been enough.\nOn Tuesday, 103 factories were ordered to shut down, and a third of government cars ordered off the roads to combat what was already being described as the worst January smog since 1954.\nBut even state-controlled media now say Beijing's tough measures were ignored by city officials themselves.\nMore than 800 government vehicles ordered off the roads were still in use, and several construction sites ordered suspended were still active on Wednesday, Xinhua reported.\nSo everyone now is looking at the weather forecast, hoping the smog will be blown away by winds forecast for Friday.\nThat's about the only thing that will bring some respite.\nA bigger question will linger even after the smog has cleared: can China curb its polluting ways for good?\nJanuary's pollution has afflicted not just Beijing and its 20 million people, but more than 30 major cities and many tens of millions of people in addition.\nAs the Communist Party's English-language tabloid the Global Times put it in an editorial on Thursday: \"China's rapid development has brought us many benefits as well as accumulated many problems. Environmental protection should take up a more prominent position in China's future strategy even if it means that China's economic development will slow down.\"\n\"Chinese people,\" the paper said, \"should not tolerate environmental pollution for the pursuit of wealth... We cannot keep going with the situation that we have today.\"\nThe difficult bit is how to change the path China is on.\nOn the plus side, then, there is a growing realisation things have to change, and the media are now being allowed to debate the issue.\nChina's government seems to be in agreement. This week the cabinet approved an energy consumption \"control target\" for energy use by 2015.\nOn the minus side, that \"control target\" still means China's energy use will continue to expand, and, crucially, so will the burning of coal.\nAs Xinhua reported: \"to meet the target, average annual energy consumption growth should be controlled at around 4.3% between 2011 and 2015, lower than the 6.6-percent annual increase realized between 2006 and 2010\".\nThat means more emissions to come.\nAnd as if to prove that changing China's habits will be hard, there is another worry on the immediate horizon.\nChinese New Year is just days away. Letting off vast quantities of fireworks is part of the Spring Festival celebrations, but the fireworks produce huge amounts of pollution.\n\"Setting off fireworks contributed greatly to air pollution in Beijing for half a month after Spring Festival in 2011,\" according to Du Shaozhong, former deputy director of Beijing Municipal Environmental Protection Bureau.\nEight million people had already posted messages on China's Weibo microblogs this week debating whether the fireworks should be stopped this year.\nBut the office in charge of Beijing's firework industry has said that residents can set off fireworks during the Spring Festival holiday according to the regulations, but that the office hopes residents will refrain from doing so, the China Daily reported.\nI predict more smog.",
        "output": "The article describes the severe air pollution in Beijing, China, caused by a combination of factors, including coal emissions, dirty diesel, and industrial gases. The city's authorities have implemented \"tough\" measures to combat the smog, such as shutting down factories and suspending government cars, but these measures have not been enough to improve the situation. The smog has affected not just Beijing but several major cities and millions of people. The Chinese government has approved an energy consumption \"control target\" to slow down the growth of energy use, but this target still means continued burning of coal and more emissions. The article also notes that Chinese New Year celebrations, which involve setting off fireworks, contribute to air pollution. The article suggests that changing China's habits of pollution will be difficult and that the media are now allowed to debate the issue. The Global Times editorial notes that environmental protection should be a more prominent part of China's future strategy, even if it means slowing down economic development.",

This would have supplemented the Public Accounts Committee which had been taking evidence on the scandal since September.\nBut after former DUP minister Jonathan Bell broke ranks on a Nolan TV special on 15 December those attempts to manage the crisis within the walls of Stormont Castle broke down.\nThen came the disastrous assembly sitting of 19 December, when the DUP decided to override Sinn Féin's concerns, pressing ahead with an Arlene Foster statement against Martin McGuinness's express wishes.\nOn the day, Sinn Féin's warning of \"grave consequences\" looked like the party might just be crying wolf. But in reality the die was cast, as republican grassroots anger grew.\nThe former Northern Ireland Secretary Lord Hain reckons Arlene Foster's handling of the fall-out from the scandal has been a \"textbook case of how not to manage a crisis\". Certainly the DUP has appeared to be caught napping by the speed with which this affair developed - offering concessions, expressions of regret or offers of inquiries too late to appease its critics.\nThe heating scandal has ignited the election, but will the battle ahead be a referendum on the RHI scandal as the Stormont opposition wants?\nFor different reasons, both the DUP and Sinn Féin are keen on widening the battleground.\nThe DUP is framing the contest as an attempt to \"take Arlene Foster down\" and to push through investigations which would put soldiers and police officers in the dock over controversial Troubles killings.\nSinn Féin say it's all about the DUP's arrogance and the failure of both the DUP and the UK government to deliver on commitments in relation to the former jail at Maze/Long Kesh, the treatment of the Irish language and the logjam over the legacy of the troubles.\nOver and above these policy matters, it look likely that any fresh talks on the other side of the election will have to consider potential structural changes at Stormont.\nShould the mandatory coalition, whereby all the major parties have a right to be in government, be abandoned in favour of a more conventional voluntary coalition? Should weighted majority voting be introduced?\nShould Northern Ireland have two joint first ministers rather than a first and deputy first?\nShould there be radical changes to the petition of concern system which has led to frequent cross-community vetoes?  In the light of Brexit, are the cross-border institutions created under the Good Friday Agreement in need of reform?\nAll this looks like the stuff of talks which will last far longer than the three weeks the law allows to form a new executive after the March election.\nWhilst the major parties may talk about all this and more, expect their critics to use the campaign ahead to remind voters what brought Stormont down.\nIt seems hard to imagine that the DUP and Sinn Féin won't emerge again as the main players. But we won't know until the votes are counted exactly what impact the negative publicity generated by the heating scandal has had on public opinion and party allegiance.\nCould a shift in opinion, for example, endanger the DUP's power to veto measures without requiring the assistance of other parties, for which 30 MLAs are required?\nThat point might be rendered academic if there is no Stormont assembly in which to wield a petition of concern.\nNevertheless the public can have their say in this election, even if it is only to determine the relative weights the parties will be able to throw around in the potentially protracted negotiations coming up.",

In the past five years, 266 of these procedures have been carried out on girls under 14.\nWhile the reasons for the procedures are unknown, they are likely to have been performed for medical reasons or to correct congenital abnormalities.\nIn another paper, published by the British Society for Paediatric and Adolescent Gynaecology (BritSPAG), clinicians are advised to inform girls under 18 that labiaplasty surgery before puberty is complete can lead to long-term problems.\nAlthough no research has been carried out on these long-term risks, it is thought that damage to sexual function and sensitivity can occur after labiaplasty. Bleeding and wound infection can also occur in the short term.\nThe paper also recommends that girls showing signs of psychological problems should be referred to a paediatric clinical psychologist.\nConsultant plastic surgeon Paul Banwell, from the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons, welcomed the recommendations published in both papers and said patients should always be given full, accurate information and be properly counselled before surgery.\nBut he said clinicians should also be sensitive to potential problems.\n\"An asymmetrical labia can lead to functional problems as well as aesthetic problems. Over 50% of my patients see me due to functional reasons. Only a small proportion are there for purely aesthetic reasons.\"\nHe also said he had seen the number of patients requesting labiaplasty increase dramatically in the past few years.\nTim Goodacre, head of professional standards at the British Association of Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgeons and a consultant plastic surgeon, said he supported the recommendations as a means of improving patient care.\n\"We would like to see tougher central regulation of the cosmetic surgery industry to help clamp down on anyone performing these operations unnecessarily, and without due consideration for patient care.\"\nBut he said he found attempts to increase profits by encouraging more female genital procedures \"abhorrent\".\nHe added: \"We urge stringent and robust restrictions on advertising such operations with a firm objective to limit any material other than that with information only.

Our response is more democracy, more openness, and more humanity. We will answer hatred with love.\"\nTerror aims first at citizens, but they need not be solely its first victims; they can become the first responders. The unity we need embraces disagreement, because the society we need and want to defend is democratic, pluralistic and diverse.\nWe might understand today that ugly prejudices seep through the fissures that the attacks created in the social fabric, but tomorrow people of all persuasions and inspirations should join hands to mend both the fissures and the prejudices.\nWe urgently need new scaffolding to repair the bombed bridges and to reconstruct a (better) way of living together.\nWords that are drenched in vitriol today are multiplied by social networks - those which always function, even when roads are blocked, trains stand still and mobile networks fail. They must be washed clean so they can be re-used for better purposes.\nE pluribus unum, reads the United States seal: \"one from many\", unity from diversity.

Traffic management, they add, should be based on objective technical requirements.\nAlthough some campaigners had suggested there might be growing support for the amendments within the parliament, all were voted down in large majorities.\nIt is thought that many MEPs would have been reluctant to begin a process of amending the regulation given that it might have delayed another aspect of the rules - the abolition of mobile data roaming charges.\nThe result is \"hardly surprising\" according to legal expert Chris Marsden at the University of Sussex, given that many of the major parties represented in the parliament all supported the regulation text without amendments.\nThe Body of European Regulators (BEREC) would now have nine months to issue guidelines to bodies like Ofcom in the UK, he added.\n\"So, [by] September next year we will have the guidelines and the real enforcement work begins,\" he told the BBC.\nDr Marsden also said there were still plenty of unknowns, such as what form regulations on \"zero ratings\" and fast and slow lane services might actually take.\nThere was also the issue of how laws in the Netherlands, Slovenia and Finland - which all have special net neutrality protections in place - would be affected.\nSome initial guidelines, Dr Marsden added, would not be ready until 2016.\nMichael Theurer, a liberal German MEP described the outcome as \"regrettable\" and added that he felt the regulations as passed do not include a clear definition of net neutrality to inform regulators.\nPrior to the vote, the inventor of the world wide web Sir Tim Berners-Lee and a host of tech companies had expressed their support for the amendments and urged MEPs to vote them through.\nFirms which has openly supported the amendments included:\n\"The fact is that what we use the internet for in 2015 is vastly different from those early days when Tim Berners-Lee was inventing the web,\" commented Chris Green of business consultancy Lewis as he pointed out that the rise of video streaming had placed extra burdens on network companies.\n\"Maintaining that information flow is an expensive process and the cost of running that infrastructure is falling on the shoulders of ISPs.\n\"For them, a two-tier internet makes much more sense,\" he told the BBC.\nThe idea that data should be ferried from place to place as quickly as possible, regardless of what it is, is how most people assume the internet works.\nThat's the essence of net neutrality.\nHowever, it's possible to decide to prioritise certain types of data over others - perhaps, for example, by charging the producers of such data a fee to make sure their content gets delivered promptly.\nFor big video streaming sites, the prospect is worrying. They could find themselves coughing up lots of money in fees simply to give their users the same experience as before.\nSome argue, however, that such fees are fair since it costs internet service providers a lot of money to keep providing such content, no matter how popular the streaming sites become.\nPart of the problem with the rules in their current form, argued Joe McNamee at the European Digital Rights campaign group, is that they are ambiguous.\n\"As the text currently stands there is no indication as to how much abuse of dominance would be permissible under this arrangement,\" he told the BBC.\nThe sort of scenarios that could impact internet use include the creation of \"fast lanes\" and \"slow lanes\" or the creation of \"zero ratings\" in which some services may be accessed without using up any of the internet user's data quota.\nIn Belgium, for example,  some mobile phone companies currently allow unlimited access to Twitter and Facebook while all other data usage is part of a monthly plan. In a few countries such as the Netherlands, such practices are not allowed.\nBesides a host of net neutrality campaigners, inventor of the world wide web Sir Tim Berners-Lee had added his voice to those supporting the amendments.\n\"If adopted as currently written, these rules will threaten innovation, free speech and privacy, and compromise Europe's ability to lead in the digital economy,\" he wrote in a blog.\nAnd a string of tech companies signed a letter to the president of the European Parliament, Martin Schulz, asking MEPs to adopt the amendments.\nThe firms included Netflix, Tumblr, Vimeo, Kickstarter and Reddit.\n\"I was contacted by a number of start-ups and investors because they were deeply concerned about the impact of the European Parliament's network neutrality proposals on start-up innovation in Europe,\" Stanford professor Barbara van Schewick, who helped pen the letter, told the BBC.\nInterestingly, three countries within the EU - Netherlands, Slovenia and Finland - already have a range of net neutrality rules enshrined in law.\nThese laws might have to be altered depending on how the new, EU-wide rules are interpreted by regulators later.\nElsewhere, net neutrality has received some regulatory protection in the United States after a vote in February this year placed new restrictions on what deals could be sought by internet firms with content providers.\nBut in other countries, such as India, \"zero rating\" is allowed.\n\"It's a fragmented picture across the board,\" said Dr Marsden.\n\"It's an extremely difficult area and there are probably no absolutely right answers.\"",

We're now going to see the truth.\"\nA web portal has been opened where anyone can play with Gaia data and look for novel phenomena.\nWhen a group of schoolchildren showed the BBC how to do it last week, they stumbled across a supernova - an exploded star.\nThe European Space Agency (Esa) launched its Gaia mission in 2013.\nIts goal was to update and extend the work of a previous satellite from the 1980s/90s called Hipparcos.\nThis observatory made the go-to Milky Way catalogue for its time - an astonishing chart of our cosmic neighbourhood.\nIt mapped the precise position, brightness, distance and proper motion (that sideways movement on the sky) of 100,000 stars.\nGaia, with its first release of data, has just increased that haul 20-fold.\nGaia's imperative - To work out how far it is to the nearest stars\nIt is a function of the leap in technology, of course.\nThe new mission actually carries two telescopes, which it scans across the Milky Way from a location about 1.5 million km from Earth.\nThe telescopes' mirrors throw their captured light on to a huge, one-billion-pixel camera detector connected to a trio of instruments.\nIt is this ultra-stable and supersensitive optical equipment that Gaia uses to pick out its sample of stars with extraordinary confidence.\nThe called-for specification was to get to know the brightest objects' coordinates down to an error of just seven micro-arcseconds.\nThis angle is equivalent to the size of a euro coin on the Moon as seen from Earth.\nIn addition to their position and proper motion, the stars are having their physical properties analysed by Gaia.\nIts instruments are acquiring details such temperature and composition. These are markers needed to help determine the stars' ages.\nNot all of this information can be gleaned at once. It will take repeat viewing, but by the end of five years of operations the 100,000 stars fully profiled by Hipparcos should become at least a billion in the Gaia catalogue. That is a conservative estimate, however.\nIf one thing is clear from the new data it is that Gaia is seeing many more fainter stars than anyone anticipated. Once the project is complete it could have plotted 2-3 billion light sources.\nGaia - The discovery machine\nAstronomers around the world will have dived into the data the moment it went live on servers on Wednesday - and for all manner of reasons.\nSome of the 1.1 billion light sources will not actually be stars; they will be the very bright centres of very distant galaxies - what are known as quasars.\nThe nature of their light can be used to calculate the mass of all the stuff between them and us - a means, in effect, to weigh the Universe.\nA good number of other data-users will be planet-hunters. By studying the way Gaia's stars appear to wobble on the sky, it should be possible to infer the gravitational presence of orbiting worlds.\n\"Gaia is going to be extremely useful for exoplanets, and especially systems that have the Jupiter kind of planets,\" said Esa's Gaia project scientist, Timo Prusti.\n\"The numbers are going to be impressive; we expect 20,000. The thing is, you need patience because the exoplanets are something where you have to collect five years of data to see the deviation in the movements.\"\nBy way of comparison, in the past 20 years of planet-hunting, astronomers have confirmed 3,000 worlds beyond our Solar System.\nOne eagerly anticipated measurement is the radial velocity of stars. This describes the movement they make towards or away from Gaia as they turn around the galaxy.\nIf this measurement is combined with the stars' proper motion, it will lay bare the dynamics of the Milky Way.\nIt should be possible, for example, to make a kind of time-lapse movie - to run forwards to see how the galaxy might evolve into the future, or to run backwards to see how our cosmic neighbourhood came to be the shape it is today.\nAt the outset of the mission, scientists had hoped to get radial velocity data on about 150 million stars.\nBut this was thrown into doubt when it was realised soon after Gaia's launch that unexpected stray light was getting into the telescope. This made the observation of the faintest stars and their colours far more challenging.\nEngineers think they understand the problem: in part it is caused by the way sunlight bends past the 10m-diameter shade that Gaia uses to keep its telescopes in shadow.\nAnd the good news according to the scientists is that they think they can work around the difficulties.\nThe longer the mission runs, they believe, the closer Gaia will get to its target of 150 million radial velocity measurements - and that movie.\n\"Clearly, with the stray light we lost sensitivity. On the other hand, it happens to be that there are more stars than were thought before. So we're still talking about 100 million radial velocities,\" Timo Prusti told BBC News.\nJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos",

Leave it to Donald Trump, however, to throw kerosene on whatever remains and dance around the ashes.\nIn a three-minute exchange with reporters in Warsaw, Mr Trump aired a wide range of his usual grievances - against the US media, his presidential predecessor and the US intelligence community.\nHere's a closer look:\nTrump:\"I've said it very simply, I think it could very well have been Russia but I think it could well have been other countries and I won't be specific, but a lot of people interfere.\"\nAnthony: The question that set Mr Trump off, from MSNBC reporter Hallie Jackson, was direct. \"Will you once and for all yes or no definitively say that Russia interfered in the 2016 election?\"\nHis answer was far from a definitive \"yes\". Instead he engaged in several paragraphs worth of water-muddying along the lines of past remarks, where he has suggested the Chinese or some \"400-pound person sitting in bed\" could be the true culprit behind the email hacks of top Democratic officials in 2016.\nTrump: \"Barack Obama, when he found out about this in terms of if it was Russia, found out about it in August. Now the election was in November. That's a lot of time he did nothing about it.\"\nAnthony: According to the Washington Post article that detailed the extent of the information available to Mr Obama at the time - including that Russian President Vladimir Putin had directly ordered election meddling -  the then-president took several steps.\nIn September, he directly warned Mr Putin face-to-face to stop Russian cyber-activities in the US. He directed his intelligence officials to reach out to congressional leadership, although the Republicans were reluctant to participate in any bipartisan call for action.\nHe also informed state governments to ensure that their electoral systems were secure.\nTrump: \"They say he choked. Well, I don't think he choked.\"\nAnthony: Mr Obama's response didn't go over well with everyone in his administration. Mr Trump is referencing a line in that same Washington Post article, from a senior Obama official who felt the US government didn't do enough to punish Russia for what appeared to be a brazen attempt to destabilise the US election.\nThere's a certain amount of irony that Mr Trump would highlight this anonymous remark, given how frequently he and his aides have condemned reliance on anonymous sources in news stories critical of his own administration.\nTrump: \"He thought Hillary Clinton was going to win the election and he said let's not do anything about it. Had he thought the other way he would have done something about it.\"\nAnthony: The Washington Post article reported that Mr Obama decided not to go public with the evidence of Russian involvement because of concerns that it might provoke further Russian action, reveal US intelligence-gathering resources or be cited by Mr Trump as evidence that Democrats were \"rigging\" the US election against him, an accusation he was regularly making in the closing days of the presidential campaign\nMr Trump has apparently concluded that if the situation for Mrs Clinton had appeared more dire, he would have been more aggressive in his response. It's a charge that is impossible to prove, of course - but it allows Mr Trump once again to bask in the unexpected nature of his presidential triumph.\nTrump: \"I heard it was 17 agencies. Boy, that's a lot. Do we even have that many intelligence agencies?\"\nAnthony: Yes, the US does. The CIA and the FBI are the big ones, but there are also intelligence divisions within the State, Defence, Homeland Security, Treasury and Energy departments, as well as multiple military intelligence offices.\nIt's not something most Americans would be expected to know. Whether those at the top of the US government should have a basic familiarity with the nation's national security establishment is another question.\nMr Trump brings this up because of New York Times and Associated press reports that all 17 agencies had signed off on the conclusion that Russia had meddled in the 2016 US election.\nTrump: \"We did some very heavy research, and it turned out to be three or four. It wasn't 17 and many of your compatriots had to change their reporting, and they had to apologise and they had to correct.\"\nAnthony: It seems like it wouldn't take too much \"heavy research\" for the administration to discover the findings of its own intelligence apparatus, but the president is correct that the New York Times and Associated Press have corrected their initial reports.\nThe assessment that Russia interfered in the 2016 election was the result of efforts by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Central Intelligence Agency and National Security Agency, and published in a report by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, which represents all US intelligence agencies. Other intelligence divisions, like Coast Guard Intelligence, the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency and the Drug Enforcement Administration's Office of National Security Intelligence would have had nothing relevant to add to the report.\nObama Administration Director of National Intelligence James Clapper pointed this out multiple times during testimony before Congress on 8 May, but the media outlets only recently modified their original articles.\nNeither the Associated Press or the New York Times \"apologised\", however.\nTrump: \"I remember that I was sitting back listening about Iraq. Weapons of mass destruction. How everybody was 100% sure that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction. Guess what, that led to one big mess. They were wrong.\"\nAnthony: During the Republican primary campaign Mr Trump frequently criticised George W Bush and members of his administration for launching the Iraq War based on the faulty conclusion that Saddam Hussein was pursuing a chemical, biological or nuclear weapons programme.\nAt the time it was considered remarkable that a Republican candidate would break with party orthodoxy on the merits of the military operation.\nMaking those charges on a debate stage is one thing, however. Highlighting the shortcomings of US intelligence on foreign soil, in front of the world media, while standing next to a fellow head of state, however, is astounding.\nTrump: \"I think what CNN did was unfortunate for them, as you know now, they have some pretty serious problems. They have been fake news for a long time, they've been covering me in a very dishonest way. Do you have that also, Mr President?\"\nAnthony: It was probably inevitable that Mr Trump would be asked to comment about Sunday's CNN-wrestling tweet, and he took the opportunity to take another swipe at the US cable news network.\nWhat makes this time a different, of course, was the president's aside to the Polish leader, who has been accused of cracking down on his own nation's free press. He recently blocked adversarial reporters from covering parliament and in January 2016 fired the executives of the nation's public radio and television networks, replacing them with individuals more friendly to the government.\nSuch an action is well outside of the power of a US president, but the New York Times did note that Mr Trump isn't without his own \"leverage\" over CNN, as his administration is currently reviewing whether to let the network's parent company, Time Warner, merge with telecommunications giant AT&T.\n\"Mr Trump's Justice Department will decide whether to approve the merger, and while analysts say there is little to stop the deal from moving forward, the president's animus toward CNN remains a wild card,\" the paper reports.\nTrump: \"NBC equally is bad, despite the fact that I made them a fortune with The Apprentice, but they forgot that.\"\nAnthony: NBC News officials will likely howl at the insinuation that their coverage could ever be influenced by commercial considerations of their network - even if the Apprentice, at least early in its 14-season run, was a ratings success.\nDonald Trump didn't make out too badly from his involvement with his reality television show, either. According to campaign disclosures, he earned more than $213m from the programme.\nAnd the visibility he received from being portrayed as a take-charge executive once a week on prime-time commercial television?\nThat, as they say, was priceless.",

I was deflated.\"\nTrott and Ruberry woke up on 24 July, the day of the opening ceremony, with no idea what was going on.\nAfter a day of discussions, Trott remembers a call was eventually made to Bermuda's leader John Swan while the opening ceremony was taking place on television screens behind them.\nSwan offered his support, and Trott and his teammates frantically got dressed into their Panama hats, blue blazers and beige shorts and rushed to Meadowbank Stadium to take part.\nHaving missed their slot, they marched on just before the host nation and received one of the biggest cheers of the night, with Scottish fans - facing a Commonwealth Games without half the Commonwealth - showing their delight.\nRuberry, meanwhile, missed the ceremony as he prepared to take part in his 100m breaststroke the following day.\nHe remembers Morbey coming into his room around midnight to confirm he would be swimming in the morning. By the time he had reached the pool, Ruberry knew it was all in vain.\nThe BOA had finally decided to remove the team from the Games.\nRuberry was disqualified for keeping his head under water at the end of his race.\nHe said: \"Your mental state was not one where you were focused on competition.\n\"It was an abysmal swim. It was nowhere near what I was prepped to do prior to that. I am not making excuses, I just did not feel ready. At one point we were packing our bags, the next moment we were unpacking our bags.\"\nAfter the team's withdrawal, Morbey went on television in disgust over the BOA's decision while the athletes hung their bed sheets out the window with 'Bermuda wants to stay, don't penalise our athletes' written on one.\nWhen the Bermudians returned home, Trott remembered an island sympathetic towards the athletes but behind the decision to boycott.\nTwenty-eight years later, the athletes still reflect on what the 1986 boycott meant for them.\nTrott said: \"It was unfortunate that we were put in a situation like that. What I learnt from all of that was politics can play a role in some cases that it shouldn't.\"\nAdventurer Mark Beaumont reports on the Queen's Baton Relay as it makes its way to 70 nations and territories of the Commonwealth. He makes regular reports online, on radio and on television\nBBC Queen's Baton Relay: Glasgow 2014\nFollow Mark Beaumont on Twitter\nFor Ruberry, the Edinburgh Games were the second time his dreams had been shattered by a political boycott after missing out on the 1980 Moscow Olympics.\nHe gave up swimming, believing the countless hours of training were not worth it when it could all be scuppered by a boycott.\nHe returned to the pool for the 1988 Olympics, and now works as a swimming coach on the island.\nHe said: \"Any sporting event brings people together. Boycotts serve to divide.\n\"They are a huge disappointment for the athletes who have been training so hard for something like that, and all of a sudden you take away the goalposts.\n\"I still to this day don't believe there is a place for boycotts in sport. There is so much more that can be accomplished by the positives - the healthy competition, people coming together.\n\"If you are going to do something political, then don't use the athletes as pawns.\"",

Bermuda was one of the nations that pulled out, but the athletes were still expected to compete. However, the Bermuda Olympic Association (BOA) decided to withdraw the team due to safety concerns and reports of safety concerns given as one of the reasons. The athletes were disappointed and felt used as pawns in a political boycott. This episode still causes frustration for the athletes, Victor Ruberry and Bill Trott, 28 years later. Ruberry even gave up swimming after missing the 1980 Moscow Olympics due to a political boycott. He now works as a swimming coach on the island.",

I'm king now.'\nThat goal against Villarreal was Neymar's 11th of the season in La Liga, making him the league's top scorer - three ahead of Ronaldo despite playing 93 fewer minutes.\nNot insignificantly, he has been in a particularly rich vein of form during Messi's spell on the sidelines, rising to the challenge of compensating for his fellow South American's absence by scoring 10 goals in his past seven club games.\nAlthough this season's achievements have been particularly impressive, nobody should be too surprised to see Neymar making such a big impact because he has been scoring goals for fun ever since breaking into the Santos first team at the age of 17.\nHe is still only 23, yet Neymar has 249 career goals: 136 for Santos, 67 for Barcelona and 46 for Brazil.\nTo put those figures into context, by the time Messi and Ronaldo reached the age Neymar is now (23 years and nine months), they had 'only' registered respective career goal tallies of 186 and 127.\nEach case is different, with Ronaldo needing some time to develop into the awesome physical specimen he is today, while Messi's younger years were spent in a Barcelona team containing other established stars who commanded more than their fair share of attention.\nFurthermore, you could argue that a chunk of Neymar's early goals came 'cheaply' as they were scored in the relatively low standard Brazilian state championship.\nWhile it does not necessarily follow that Neymar will end up scoring more goals than Messi and Ronaldo simply because he has scored more than them by his current age, surely it suggests that this young man from Sao Paulo should be taken seriously as a potential all-time great?\nNeymar's electrifying performances over the past few weeks have attracted considerable attention in Spain and Albert Masnou, the deputy editor of Barcelona-based newspaper Sport, believes he is playing better than Ronaldo.\n\"At the moment he is surpassing Ronaldo,\" Masnou told BBC Sport. \"Cristiano is enduring a 'grey' period, uncomfortable with his club and his coach. He isn't leading his team or serving as their reference point, although that could easily change in just one game.\n\"But Neymar has become more integral to Barca. He is more consistent and growing a lot as the years go by. Now he is capable of leading the team when Messi's not there, and we are seeing his full potential.\"\nThose views were echoed by a man who knows Neymar extremely well: Tata Martino, who was his coach at Barcelona when he arrived from Santos in the summer of 2013 and who is now in charge of Argentina.\nBefore last week's World Cup qualifier between the two nations, Martino commented: \"Neymar has reached a point of maturity. What he's doing now puts him on a level with the two footballers we consider above the rest.\"\nRonaldinho, who remains a revered figure among Barcelona fans, was also glowing in his tribute of his countryman as he enthused: \"Neymar is a phenomenon. It's nice to see a Brazilian continuing to make history and I think he can be the greatest in the world.\"\nIt will soon get much harder for Neymar to maintain his recent standards, however, because Messi's absence through injury is nearly over. And when that happens, the focus of the Barca team and everyone else - fans, media and opponents - will immediately return to the Argentine.\nMessi is, quite simply, the man around whom the Catalans have built their team, and when he is on the pitch the primary function of the other 10 players is to service him.\nMessi's status is illustrated off the pitch by the parrot-like phrase trotted out weekly by every Barca player that he is \"the best player in the world\", and manager Luis Enrique notably brushed aside a question after the Villarreal game asking whether Neymar is the second best, instead blandly asserting that he is proud to coach lots of great players.\nConsidering Messi's consistent greatness, the reliance upon him is understandable. But it does mean the other players are forced to somewhat subdue their natural games in order to meet the demands of contributing to a team built around Messi.\nSome, such as Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Alexis Sanchez, have been forced to leave in order to allow their personal talents to flourish. Others - and there is perhaps no better example than Neymar - have accepted that role and made the most out of playing for Messi first, the team second and themselves third.\nMasnou says Neymar will, in the short term, have no problem stepping out of the spotlight once Messi returns.\n\"He didn't join Barca to overshadow Messi, but to be his heir,\" Masnou said. \"Neymar has been the king for two months but he knows that when Messi is there, the leader is Messi.\"\nNeymar is widely regarded in Barcelona as the heir apparent: the player lined up to become the team's focal point when Messi has retired or entered into decline.\nThe question, however, is how much longer Neymar will be prepared to accept that role. Messi is only 28 and could still be performing at or near his peak for another four or five years.\nBy then, Neymar will be in his late 20s and may well have grown tired of being the chief member of the supporting cast rather than taking the lead role.\nPerhaps the key for Barca will be to create a slightly more level playing field, one which places just as much importance in Neymar as it does in Messi: to use Masnou's poetic phrase, a system which makes them \"equal protagonists\".\nThe past few weeks have suggested that Neymar is good enough to merit a more elevated standing, placing him shoulder to shoulder with Messi rather than deferentially looking up to him.\nWhether Messi will be prepared to share his crown is another matter.",
        "output": "Barcelona football star Neymar has been scoring goals at an impressive rate, including a spectacular goal against Real Madrid in the first Clasico of the season, and has overtaken Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo as La Liga's top scorer.

It was a big moment for the club because an awful lot of work had been done to get to that stage.\n\"To see the ground full for a Test match and a one-day international match [both against Australia] is what a lot of people have worked hard towards.

But Greece's creditors have made it clear they will not support a bailout for the country unless there is a comprehensive plan to reduce spending and increase revenues.\nOn Wednesday, the Greek government submitted fresh reform proposals.\nThe new plan foresees increasing government revenues through a crackdown on tax evasion and fraud, and a new lottery designed to encourage payment of sales tax.\nBut it also includes extra spending, including increased pension payments and and rise in the minimum wage.\nGreece's creditors will now decide whether these latest reform proposals go far enough to unlock the bailout money.\nIn the interview, Mr Barroso pointed out that there were poorer countries lending money to Greece who would not support the idea of Greece's debts being written off.\nHe called on Greece to take responsibility for its financial plight and implement structural reforms, which was now the most important issue for the country.\n\"It was not Germany or any other member of the EU that created the problems in Greece - the problems in Greece are structural: low productivity and previous governments.\"\nNations such as Ireland, Portugal and Spain had come back from the financial brink and Mr Barroso said Greece could do the same: \"There is nothing regarding Greece that prevents it being successful, but... bad politics have created a lot of problems for Greece.\"\nGreece's previous proposals failed to satisfy its main creditors, the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF).\nBut France's finance minister, Michel Sapin, said Greece's new proposals did represent some improvement in Athen's position.\n\"There is progress with the last list... Is there a need for more progress? Yes - in the quantification of the measures,\" he said.\nA decision may not come before Greece is due to make a â‚¬450m (Â£330m) payment to the IMF on 9 April.\nEurozone finance ministers are likely to reserve any formal judgement for the next scheduled meeting in Riga on 24 April.\nDespite the ongoing bail-out negotiations, Mr Barroso said a Greek departure from the eurozone was still a possibility. He said that would still be \"negative\", but that he believed it would be less damaging now because financial markets were much more confident than they had been in recent years.\nHowever, he added that a \"Grexit\" would still leave the idea of monetary union in doubt. \"It breaks a taboo and sets a precedent,\" he said.\nThe former EC chief and Portuguese prime minister also reiterated his view that Britons would be worse off if the UK left the European Union.\n\"I believe they would lose a lot if [the country] leaves the EU, because today, in the 21st century, versus the US, China, countries of 60 million people cannot speak at the same level - they do not have the same leverage - and we have to use the EU and our common leverage to count in the world.\"\nMr Barroso, 59, is now a visiting professor at Princeton University and the University of Geneva.\nBusiness Live airs at 07.30GMT each weekday on BBC World TV.",

For example, the bonuses in the UK finance and insurance sector were shared between more than a million employees - considerably more than on Wall Street. There were people paid very high bonuses but also people paid much more modest ones. The average overall was £13,300, but I would expect that to mask quite a range.\nBut the other question is, what is this an indicator for and what would make it rise or fall?\nSo, for example, imagine that 100,000 people earning minimum wage suddenly received a pay rise of £1 an hour. They would no longer be earning minimum wage, so the total amount paid to workers on the minimum wage would fall considerably and as a result the amount paid out in bonuses would be a higher multiple of it. But it would be hard to argue that their pay rise had increased inequality.\nNonetheless, if you were outraged by the figure from the US then you will be just as outraged that the same appears to be true in the UK.",
        "output": "A recent study by the Institute for Policy Studies found that in 2014, Wall Street employees received over twice the amount of bonuses than the annual pay of all Americans who worked full-time at the federal minimum wage. In the UK, the finance and insurance sector paid out bonuses worth £14.4bn in 2013-14, which is the closest proxy for the Wall Street bonus pool. However, if all minimum wage earners in the UK were paid the highest level of minimum wage, their total earnings would be £5.9bn, which is less than half the amount paid in bonuses. The average overall bonus in the UK finance and insurance sector was £13,300, but this masks a range of modest to high bonuses. The study suggests that the amount paid out in bonuses is an indicator of inequality, but a pay rise for minimum wage earners would not necessarily increase inequality.",

Well, a few otherwise-unoccupied social media users in China have dug up some gems.\nSome curiosities have crept into business names from internet memes.\n\"Shenyang Prehistoric Powers Hotel Management Limited Company\" might sound weird but less so to Chinese sports fans who remember swimmer Fu Yuanhui.\nShe famously won a bronze medal at the Rio Olympics, afterwards declaring: \"I have used all my prehistoric powers to swim!\"\nThere are also lots of restaurants and cafes with the phrase \"skinny blue mushroom\".\nThe phrase originated from a meme which mocked a man from Guangxi province who uploaded a video of himself talking about his loneliness while his girlfriend was away.\n\"Unbearable, I want to cry,\" he moaned - but thanks to his accent, it ended up sounding more like \"skinny blue mushroom\".\nOne of the best known offbeat names on Chinese social media is a condom company called \"Uncle Niu\".\nOr, more accurately, \"There Is a Group of Young People With Dreams, Who Believe They Can Make the Wonders of Life Under the Leadership of Uncle Niu Internet Technology Co Ltd.\"\nIt's not concise, but at least it's positive.\nOthers aren't so upbeat, especially when it comes to home life.\nAnd given \"Beijing Scared of Wife Technology Company\" and \"Anping County Scared of Wife Netting Products Factory\" are both registered companies, the trend doesn't seem to be limited by industry or region.\nThe rules of written Chinese are vastly different to those of written English, so many names seem far stranger in translation than in the original tongue.\nEnglish names can seem pretty strange in Chinese too, and there's a cottage industry among branding agencies to help western companies come up with names for the Chinese market.\nWestern company names often follow the name of their founder (think Boeing, Ford or Gucci), which might have no direct translation.\nOr they might be a concocted portmanteau (think Verizon, which is the Latin word \"veritas\" meaning truth, with horizon bolted on to the end) or maybe even just tech nonsense (Etsy, Hulu).\n\"What we think is most important to come up with a name that captures the spirit of the brand,\" says Tait Lawton, from Nanjing Marketing Group, which provides naming services.\nWestern companies sometimes try to phonetically replicate the original, or come up with a Chinese name that's fairly neutral in meaning.\nOthers will come up with a new name that tries other ways of encapsulating the brand.\n\"BMW's current Chinese name is 宝马.

Free of hangers-on, less bombastic but painfully aware he remains lumbered with something of an image problem.\n\"I learned a whole heap from my loss against George Groves,\" says DeGale of his only pro defeat, by his bitter domestic rival in 2011.\n\"During the build-up I was a bit too vocal, telling him he was ugly and his breath smelt.

The jury's decision should \"end the litigation\", he said, and force J&J to settle the remaining cases.\nAnalysis: James Gallagher, health editor, BBC news website\nIs talc safe?\nThere have been concerns for years that using talcum powder, particularly on the genitals, may increase the risk of ovarian cancer.\nBut the evidence is not conclusive. The International Agency for Research on Cancer classifies talc used on the genitals as \"possibly carcinogenic\" because of the mixed evidence.\nWhy is there any debate?\nThe mineral talc in its natural form does contain asbestos and does cause cancer. However, asbestos-free talc has been used in baby powder and other cosmetics since the 1970s. But the studies on asbestos-free talc give contradictory results.\nIt has been linked to a cancer risk in some studies, but there are concerns that the research may be biased as the studies often rely on people remembering how much talc they used years ago. Other studies have argued there is no link at all and there is no link between talc in contraceptives such as diaphragms and condoms (which would be close to the ovaries) and cancer.\nAlso, there does not seem to be a \"dose-response\" for talc, unlike with known carcinogens like tobacco where the more you smoke, the greater the risk of lung cancer.\nThe charity Ovacome says there is no definitive evidence and that the worst-case scenario is that using talc increases the risk of cancer by a third.\nBut it adds: \"Ovarian cancer is a rare disease, and increasing a small risk by a third still gives a small risk. So even if talc does increase the risk slightly, very few women who use talc will ever get ovarian cancer.\"\nA J&J spokeswoman said the verdict contradicted 30 years of research supporting the safety of cosmetic talc.\nCarol Goodrich said the company intends to appeal and will keep defending its products' safety.\nThe case follows another one in February, in which Johnson & Johnson was ordered to pay $72m to the family of a woman who claimed her death was linked to use of the company's Baby Powder talc.\nJackie Fox from Birmingham, Alabama died of ovarian cancer last year, aged 62, having used the talc for decades.\nHer family argued that the firm knew of talc risks and failed to warn users.\nJ&J is appealing against that verdict, which sparked renewed interest in talc-powder lawsuits. Lawyers accuse J&J of failing to warn that talc was linked to an increased risk for ovarian cancer - a claim J&J denies.

Hatton, who also tied for fifth at the Open at Royal Troon, is now heading to the US PGA in 10 days. Hatton admits he still needs to work on keeping a cool head and acknowledges that his emotions can still get the better of him on the course. However, he credits his new caddie, Chris Rice, and his father, who is his coach, for helping him maintain his focus. Hatton is also confident about his chances at the USPGA after earning a place in the field for the second year running, giving him a chance to build on last year's tie for 25th at Whistling Straits. Hatton's surge in form means he is now within reach of a Ryder Cup place, but after the USPGA, his main interest is a planned holiday in New York with his girlfriend. Hatton's best performances are on links courses and he's confident about his short game, which helped him grind out a decent score at the Open. Hatton only dropped four other shots all week at Troon and believes his par putts helped keep the momentum going.",

Just a metre in height (hence the affectionate nickname), it was initially thought they could have been living as recently as 12,000 years ago.\nSubsequent analysis has shown they actually existed slightly further back in time, between 50,000 and 60,000 years ago - not that this lessened the fascination with the diminutive species more properly called Homo floresiensis.\nAnd now comes new research from some of the scientists involved in the original discovery that reveals insights on the Hobbit's lineage.\nThe team presents much older fossils, dating back 700,000 years, unearthed at a site named Mata Menge.\nThese remains consist of a piece of lower jawbone and several teeth. They are remarkably similar to those of the Hobbit find in 2004 and are thought to belong to the ancestors of floresiensis.\nThere are also stone tools at the same site which are much older still, suggesting ancient human-like creatures lived on Flores a million years ago. One theory is that these people were another normal-sized species we now refer to as Homo erectus, which was known to live on the island of Java, about 500 km west of Flores.\nAccording to Dr Yousuke Kaifu, from Tokyo's National Museum of Nature and Science, the discovery of the tiny 700,000 year old hobbit ancestor suggests that erectus might have shrunk within the space of just 300,000 years, which is a remarkably short period in evolutionary terms.\n\"What is truly unexpected is that the size of the finds indicates that Homo floresiensis had already obtained its small size by at least 700,000 years ago.\"\nDr Gert van den Bergh, from the University of Wollongong's Centre for Archaeological Science, who led the team, said the entire team was surprised at the small size of the adult jawbone.\n\"We were expecting to find something larger than what we found, something closer to the size of the original founder population,  Homo erectus, but it turns out that they were as small if not smaller than Homo floresiensis.\n\"The rapid evolution seems quite fast but we have no examples of human or primates (shrinking) on other islands to compare it to.\"\nThe theory is that erectus shrank to cope with the Island's relatively meagre resources. But the big question is how did it get there. Homo erectus was too primitive to build boats and it was too far for the species to swim from Java to Flores. One possibility, is that individuals were swept across by a giant tidal wave, according to the researchers.\nBut Prof Chris Stringer of the Natural History Museum in London believes that the evidence for the rapid shrinking theory is circumstantial: \"We do not know how large the tool-makers at one million years actually were, since we do not have their fossils yet; and, secondly, we cannot be sure that the evidence at one million years actually represents the first arrival of humans on Flores.\"\nHe added: \"It is just as likely that the ancestors of (The Hobbit) came from somewhere like Sulawesi, to the North, and we have no evidence so far of who might have been there more than a million years ago.\"\nThe researchers acknowledge that their argument is based on scant data: one fragment of a jawbone and a handful of teeth. But Dr Adam Brum of Griffiths University in Australia says the team hopes to gather more fossils to build up a more complete picture.\n\"We want to know what the very, very first (humans) that set foot on the island were like. That involves finding the fossils that date back to before a million years ago and which go with the stone tools.\"\nDr van den Bergh added that the discovery of Hobbit-like humans living on Flores 700,000 years ago ruled out the possibility that the discovery in 2004 was of a group of modern humans who had been stunted by illness.\n\"This find quashes once and for all any doubters that believe Homo floresiensis was merely a sick modern human.\"\nFollow Pallab on Twitter",

They were fearless and docile, confused and dazed; the antithesis of their usual ferocious and wary demeanour.\nOver the next few years evidence mounted that this, the largest living felid, was suffering from an infectious agent and the indications - the nature of the illness, historical understanding of wild cat infections and the diagnosis, in a single wild tiger, of a virus belonging to the morbillivirus genus - provided a likely culprit.\nA study published in the journal mBio, confirmed these suspicions. Genetic analysis of several dead tiger samples showed that canine distemper virus was the cause.\nCanine distemper virus (CDV), a relative of the human measles virus, was first described in dogs and infection causes fatal pneumonia and encephalitis (inflammation of the brain).\nBut this virus is incredibly promiscuous and can infect jump into a variety of different animals - usually with catastrophic effects.\nTwo suspected CDV outbreaks, the first in 1988 and a second in 2000, killed thousands of Baikal then Caspian seals.\nThe virus has also ripped through Africa, with fatal outbreaks in silver-backed jackals and bat-eared foxes and catastrophic die-offs in wild dog populations that continue to this day.\nFor years, cats were thought resistant to CDV. Yes, domestic cats could be infected in the laboratory, but this was inefficient and the virus was unable to pass from one animal to another.\nA massive demise in 1994 of African lions living in the Serengeti national park in Tanzania showed that this was fallacy. This population of closely monitored lions succumbed to CDV. Whilst only 34 lion deaths were documented during the outbreak, this was only the tip of the iceberg.\nBefore CDV struck, the lion population numbered 3,000, but afterwards this had fallen by a third. In the same outbreak, countless hyenas, bat-eared foxes and leopards also perished.\nAdd to this the recent report of infection of large numbers of South American jaguar and it is evident that this virus has little, if any respect for the so-called species barrier - the unique inherent host factors and properties that prevent viruses from jumping from one species to another.\nIn an intriguing turn of events, CDV was also starting to spark fatal outbreaks in various primates.\nSo what should we make of the emergence of CDV infection in primates. Is this an indication of the potential for a more compelling species jump? Could CDV do the unthinkable and infect humans?\nThe simple answer is a resounding yes. At least, in theory it is.\nTo replicate, a virus has to get into a host cell.  It does this through interactions between proteins on its surface with proteins - receptors - on the surface of the cell. These receptors act as gateways into the cell and if the virus protein fits then infection takes place.\nDifferent animals possess slightly different versions of these receptors on their cells so the virus proteins also have to change to be able to unlock them.\nA single mutation in one of surface proteins in CDV present in primates is all it takes for the virus to successfully use the human receptor. This is a tiny species barrier.\nBut before banishing the pet dog to a high containment kennel then donning personal protective clothing before you go near, there's a key part of the story we need to consider - one that's probably been protecting us for all of these years.\nWhen you're exposed to a virus your body recognises it as foreign and your blood cells generate antibodies which bind to the virus surface proteins and protect us from infection. It's the basis for vaccination.\nFortunately, the surface protein of the measles virus is so similar to CDV that antibodies generated by the measles vaccine also protect against CD; and other morbilliviruses too.\nBut, if we ever eradicate measles and stop vaccination, maybe then we will be susceptible to CDV.\nBut what of the Amur tiger - will CDV ensure its ultimate demise?\nAs Dr Denise McAloose, lead author on the mBio paper, explained: \"When you're talking about four to five hundred animals and your losing reproductive females and their offspring, the overall impact on populations is huge.\n\"Some of the earlier modelling work, if it were to pan out, does suggest that this is a significant disease even at the levels of disease we are detecting now, which is probably just the tip of the iceberg.\"\nA bleak outlook that is shared by a University of Nottingham colleague, veterinary virologist Dr Rachael Tarlinton: \"Because they are such tiny populations even relatively small mortality events can seriously harm their genetic diversity and this might just be enough to push them over the edge.\"\nHopefully it's not too late. We know that CDV vaccines work and a targeted vaccination programme might just pull Amur tigers back from the brink.\nCurrent CDV vaccines have to be injected - no trivial task when the animal you want to protect is so difficult to track down and so dangerous to handle.\nBut not all vaccines need to be injected - some very effective vaccines have been developed for oral delivery and these have been pivotal in our fight against rabies.\nIn the late 1970s, Switzerland pioneered the widespread deployment of enticing baits laced with rabies vaccine that would be eaten by rabies-susceptible wild animals, thereby protecting them.\nSo successful was this approach that following a similar campaign that spanned more than two decades, Germany was declared rabies-free.\nWhilst development of an oral vaccine is scientifically feasible, it is unlikely ever to become a reality. As Dr Tarlinton explains: \"It was worth developing the oral bait vaccines for rabies because of the human zoonosis risk, but something for a purely veterinary disorder, particularly one that infects wildlife rather than livestock? It's difficult to justify the economics of doing it, even if we should.\"\nEven though vaccinating tigers is unfeasible there is an alternative: identify the reservoir and remove the virus at source through vaccination campaigns. This has proven very effective in protecting CDV-threatened lion populations in Africa.\nBut do we know what the reservoir is? Domestic dogs have been implicated in all epidemics involving wildlife but, because the virus can infect other animals, you have to be sure.\nAnd this is what Dr McAloose and her colleagues have turned their attention to.\n\"We have to understand if there's a reservoir.\n\"We're trying to identify how the virus is cycling through the system to understand what the carriers are, and only with these results would we be able to make the appropriate recommendations.\"\nFor the sake of the Amur tigers, I wish them well in their quest.",
        "output": "The Amur tiger, the largest living feline, is facing a new threat: canine distemper virus (CDV). After decades of being a reclusive animal, the tigers started to wander onto roads and into villages in the Russian Far East. The virus, which is relatively harmless to domestic cats, killed thousands of Baikal and Caspian seals in the 1990s. African lions living in the Serengeti national park in Tanzania also succumbed to CDV in 1994, and the virus has also caused massive die-offs in wild dog populations. CDV can infect a variety of animals, and it has the potential to infect humans. However, the surface protein of the measles virus is similar to CDV's, which means that antibodies generated by the measles vaccine also protect against CDV, and other morbilliviruses. A targeted vaccination programme might pull Amur tigers back from the brink, but the development of an oral vaccine is unlikely due to its lack of feasibility. The researchers are trying to identify the reservoir of the CDV to understand what the carriers are, and to make appropriate recommendations.",

It's also exactly 10 years since he won the same prize for his 2006 Irish drama The Wind That Shakes The Barley, starring Cillian Murphy.\nLoach uses I, Daniel Blake to expose the welfare system in the UK, and says he wants the film \"to break audience's hearts, but also to make them angry\".\nDaniel Blake, played by stand-up comedian Dave Johns, is an older man living in Newcastle who, because of a heart attack, can no longer do his job.\nHowever, a mobility test by the Department of Work and Pensions declares him fit for work and while he waits for his appeal, Daniel Blake can only claim Jobseekers Allowance.\nHis inability to take any work offered means his money is stopped, and he begins to go hungry.\nLoach, a social campaigner for most of his career, believes the current criteria for claiming benefits in the UK is \"a Kafka-esque, Catch 22 situation designed to frustrate and humiliate the claimant to such an extent that they drop out of the system and stop pursuing their right to ask for support if necessary\".\n\"The state's attitude is not an accident,\" he claims.\n\"The poverty, the indignity, the humiliation people go through is consciously done.\n\"The state is knowingly inefficient or cruel, knowing that people will be driven to frustration, despair, hunger and possible suicide.\n\"Claimants are portrayed as 'scroungers' in the media but research has found that less than 1% of claims for benefits are fraudulent.\n\"That's certainly less than the figures for tax evasion, for example.\n\"But there's an attitude that suggests that if you're poor, it's your fault. If you are out of a job, it's your fault. It's done to get the numbers down and the most vulnerable in our society are suffering as a result.\"\nHalf a century ago, Ken Loach wrote the screenplay for the BBC play Cathy Come Home, which examined homelessness in Britain in 1966, and the director says his latest film \"is a snapshot of how life can be lived in Britain in 2016\".\n\"We wanted to explore the human consequences of welfare policy in terms of relationships, and who people become through these policies.\"\nLoach and his long-time collaborator, writer Paul Laverty, spent several months visiting British cities such as Stoke, Newcastle, Liverpool and Glasgow, meeting people seeking work, or on low-paid or zero-hour contracts.\n\"We started in my home town of Nuneaton and met a young lad there who was sleeping on a mattress in a charity home.\n\"He was doing the odd bit of work on zero-hour contracts, he'd given up on benefits - he said it was too humiliating.\n\"He hadn't worked for a couple of weeks, and the week before he hadn't eaten for four days.\n\"I opened his fridge and there was nothing in it - nothing at all. And this was one of the first people we encountered.\"\nLoach and Laverty say they also based a pivotal scene in the film, where a mother arrives at a food bank having not eaten for days, on a real anecdote from one of the centres they visited in Glasgow.\n\"Food banks have been praised by the state without any sense of shame at all and yet it's appalling in 2016 that people are having to make the choice between food and heating, which is common.\n\"After the war in 1945, we were desperately poor in Britain, but there is no way people would have been starving, their communities wouldn't have let them.\n\"That we now have this situation is testament to the policy of individualism that successive governments have pursued.\n\"It's shocking that we are apparently such a wealthy nation with such grotesque wealth at the top and such desperate poverty and fear at the very bottom.\"\nThe film has won widespread acclaim from critics, with Variety magazine calling it \"one of Loach's finest films, a drama of tender devastation, a work of scalding and moving relevance\".\nBut despite its concentration on the UK welfare system, Loach, who will be 80 next month, insists that the movie also applies to an international audience.\n\"There is a conscious cruelty in the way we organise our lives now which means the most vulnerable people in society, such as the disabled, are caught in this unfair situation.\n\"They are often unable to live with dignity, and instead suffer pain and deep despair.\n\"It's deeply shocking that this is happening at the heart of our world.\"\nI, Daniel Blake will be released in the UK later this year",

I hope he enjoys his retirement, he really deserves it.\n\"He's always put snooker first, been a model professional, a credit to the game and I'll see him in the legends tour this year for more battles.\n\"It is his brutal frankness about his love of winning, more than the winning itself, that takes the breath away.\"\nRead more of Ben's blog\n\"I thank him sincerely for some of the best matches and memories of my own career.

He always had the extra gear of focus. He got a maximum recently, showing there's life in the old dog still.\n\"This announcement has come as a little bit of a shock. He will be missed. I don't think he's made the right decision to bow out.\n\"But he was a phenomenal player and a really nice bloke. When you watch someone like Hendry in action, it's an art form.\"\nFormer world champion Terry Griffiths, who once coached Hendry, added: \"I thought he should have retired a while ago but he had the belief that he could continue.\n\"He was blessed with a skill. His will and desire to win was frightening.\n\"Everybody says they want to win, but Stephen Hendry wanted to win even more.\"\nMaguire added: \"I'm shocked, I wasn't expecting that but Stephen has obvioulsy thought long and hard about it.\n\"I'm just pretty sad that he's retired.

        "input": "Summarize the following article into nine sentences:\nThree years after Russia annexed Crimea, a move bitterly contested by Ukraine's government, the region remains in a state of flux. It's difficult to get into, and for many people, it's difficult to know where it's going.\nAt Kiev International Airport, I hand my passport to a border guard.\n\"Purpose of visit?\" he asks.\n\"Journalism. I'm with the BBC.\"\nHe pauses. He studies my passport. He seems to be checking a list. He goes to pick up a telephone and asks a question. He does not realise I can hear.\n\"You remember that pro-Russian journalist from the BBC? Was his surname Rosenberg?\"\nAnother pause.\n\"It wasn't? OK, thanks.\" He hangs up. He stamps my passport and returns it.\n\"Welcome to Ukraine!\" he smiles.\nThose pauses at passport control are an indication of the current tension between Moscow and Kiev - a relationship clouded by enmity and suspicion.\nOur BBC team is only passing through Kiev. Our final destination is Crimea, the Ukrainian peninsula annexed by Russia three years ago.\nFor journalists based in Russia, there are faster ways of reaching the Crimean peninsula. Board a plane in Moscow and two hours later you can be in the Crimean capital Simferopol. Ukraine, however, warns foreign nationals that anyone entering \"temporarily occupied Crimea\" without Kiev's permission and without crossing an official Ukrainian border may be banned from future entry to Ukraine.\nWe're taking the longer route.\nDirect flights from Russia to Ukraine stopped in October 2015. We flew from Moscow to the Belarusian capital Minsk, then on to Kiev. Ahead of us is an eight-hour road trip to Crimea.\nFirst, we visit the Ukrainian Migration Service in Kiev to obtain the \"dozvil\" - a document issued by the Ukrainian authorities permitting travel to Crimea. Three hours later, permission slips in hand, our long car journey south begins.\nRussia's annexation of Crimea in 2014 was a watershed moment. It pushed Moscow and the West to the brink of a new cold war. Three years on we are travelling to Crimea to gauge the mood.\nIt is dark by the time we reach the final Ukrainian checkpoint before the peninsula. Ukraine does not call the Kalanchak crossing a border - officially, it is a \"control point for entry and exit\". We show our passports and dozvils. Minutes later we are waved through.\nThe no-man's land between the Ukrainian and Russian checkpoints is tiny - no more than 50m long. We stop here to change cars - our Kiev driver will turn back.  A driver from Simferopol has come to meet us.\nOn the Russian side this is called the Armyansk crossing. As far as the Russians are concerned, it is an official state border. We show passports and visas and fill out immigration cards. Our documents are in order, but we are asked to wait. The appearance here of British journalists has raised official eyebrows.\nA young man in civilian clothes approaches me. \"Come with me, please,\" he says, \"I'd like to have a chat.\"\nWe enter a small room and sit down at a table. He checks my phone to make sure I am not recording our conversation.\nThen come the questions. Lots of them.\n\"What mission have your editors set you? What will you be filming? How will you be saving your material, on computers or hard drives? What SIM card will you be using in Crimea? As the correspondent, will you be making notes each night about what you have filmed? Can you show me some of the photos on your phone? Where will you be staying? Why didn't you fly direct from Moscow?\"\nMy interrogator notes down my answers on a piece of paper. His questions are not limited to Crimea.\n\"What street do you live on in Moscow? What is the nearest Metro station to your home? What does your wife do for a living? You've been in Russia a long time. Have you ever considered applying for a Russian passport?\"\n\"My British one suits me just fine,\" I reply.\n\"What do you think of English cuisine?\" he asks, adding, \"I like Jamie Oliver. Although I consider he uses too much oil.\"\nThe questioning lasts an hour. Then the official escorts me back to the van. I ask for his name.\n\"I have no name,\" he replies, \"only a rank.\"\nThe inquisitive young man with \"no name, only a rank\" invites my colleagues for similar conversations.\nThree hours pass. Interrogations over, we are still not free to go. We spend the night in the van waiting for Russian customs officers to process our papers and allow our TV equipment through. Ten hours after arriving at the Armyansk crossing, we finally clear the checkpoint.\nSimferopol is the administrative centre of Crimea. The name of our hotel is the \"Ukraine\". But three years after annexation, the town feels Russian. Most of the cars have switched to Russian number plates, brand new buses manufactured near Moscow have taken to the roads. And, peering down from billboards is the Russian president with some of his choicest Crimea quotations - just to remind everyone who is in charge.\n\"Crimea was famous for being the spa of the Soviet Union,\" declares Vladimir Putin in one poster. \"We will, of course, develop this.\"\n\"All Russian army social programmes will be extended to Sevastopol and the Black Sea Fleet,\" he promises in another.\nNear our hotel, the wall of a building is covered with a giant painting of President Putin dressed as a sailor and the words: \"Crimea belongs to all of us\".\nAs far as retired teacher Olga Koziko is concerned, the more Putin in Crimea, the better.\n\"Crimea is a place where people support Putin,\" Olga assures me. \"We just adore him. He's our hero. I even have a T-shirt with Putin and the words: 'In Putin We Trust', like 'In God We Trust.' Thanks to Putin, Russian soldiers came to protect us.\"\nOn 22 February 2014, Ukraine's pro-Moscow president Viktor Yanukovych fled the country after what he - and his Russian allies - called an \"illegal coup\" in Kiev. On 27 February masked men in unmarked uniforms appeared in Simferopol. Armed with Russian weapons, they seized government buildings, the parliament, the airport and blocked Ukrainian army bases. This mysterious military force picked up a variety of nicknames, including The Little Green Men and The Polite People.\nToday Moscow admits the soldiers were from Russia's secretive Special Operations Forces (the SSO). President Putin subsequently signed a decree making 27 February an annual celebration in Russia - \"Special Operations Forces Day\".\nFollowing a hastily organised referendum, it was announced that more than 95% of people who had taken part had voted for Crimea's \"reunification\" with Russia. The referendum was not recognised by the international community. To the outside world, Russia had grabbed a piece of Ukraine.\nA statue honouring The Little Green Men has been erected near the Crimean parliament building. It depicts a young girl handing flowers to a man with a gun. The inscription reads: \"To The Polite People from the grateful people of Crimea.\"\nThis is how Moscow wants to be seen here: as a force for good, protecting the people of Crimea from violent Ukrainian nationalists. In 2014 Russia's state-controlled media characterised the new Ukrainian government as \"fascists\", \"neo-Nazis\" and an \"illegitimate junta''. Olga uses similar language as she recalls the past.\n\"Without Russia, a lot of people would have been killed here,\" maintains Olga. \"Ukrainian Nazis said Crimea would either be part of Ukraine or empty. People would have been oppressed. Perhaps even put in concentration camps.\"\nThere is absolutely no evidence to substantiate Olga's claims.\nMany of those in Crimea who welcome Moscow's rule see the bloody conflict in eastern Ukraine as confirmation that Russia is a safer home. They discount evidence that unrest in the Donbass was incited and bankrolled by Moscow.\nOut on the street I get chatting to a pensioner called Nadezhda. Until recently her sister had been living in Luhansk, one of the self-proclaimed separatist republics in eastern Ukraine.\n\"Life in Luhansk is terrible,\" Nadezhda says. \"So I moved my sister to Crimea. I will do everything to make sure that kind of violence doesn't break out here.\"\nThere is another reason why Nadezhda, an ethnic Ukrainian, trusts Moscow more than Kiev - it is out of nostalgia for Soviet times, when she regarded Moscow as her capital. Nadezhda describes Crimea joining Russia as \"a return to the Soviet Union.  Our generation was, is and will always be in the USSR. We will die in the Soviet Union.\"\nNostalgia and fear are powerful feelings. But they are not enough to sustain pro-Russia sentiment in Crimea at the level of 2014.\nSevering ties to Ukraine has brought problems. With economic links to Ukraine cut, the only way of keeping the peninsula supplied is by sea or air. That means higher prices. Moscow insists that will change once it has completed a road and rail bridge linking Crimea to the Russian mainland. The bridge is a multibillion-dollar statement that Moscow is here to stay.\nAs well as higher prices, there is Russian red tape.\nI visit a document registration centre in Simferopol. More than two hundred people are queueing outside. They have come to exchange Ukrainian documents, like deeds for apartments, for Russian ones. Some people, like Alyona, have been queuing here all night.\n\"Life hasn't got better or worse,\" Alyona tells me, \"We're still standing in lines, like we always used to. Maybe some people had big expectations three years ago. But I don't believe in miracles.\"\nI ask Alyona if she could imagine Russia handing Crimea back to Ukraine.\n\"Nothing would surprise me any more,\" she laughs. \"I wouldn't be surprised if we suddenly ended up as part of Turkey. To be honest, I don't care if we're with China! The most important thing is that there is no war.\n\"I've learnt that your life can be turned upside down in a day. And there is nothing you can do about it. We're like pawns on a chessboard. They're playing with us. Today our place is in Russia. And tomorrow? Who knows. Maybe that's for the best: if we knew, we might have a heart attack.\"\nAcross town, I meet Nadia. She is complaining to me about potholes.\n\"Where I live there are potholes everywhere,\" Nadia says. \"People have been hurting their legs. I've written to the authorities asking them to do something. They haven't lifted a finger.\"\nNadia's disappointment extends further than pavements and roads.\n\"Many people here were happy, but there is disillusionment now,\" she tells me, \"because there is no investment and salaries and pensions are small. My pension is 8000 roubles ($140; Â£112) a month. Just about enough to cover utility bills and the medicines I need.\"\nI am talking to Nadia beside the statue of Ukraine's most famous 19th Century poet, Taras Shevchenko. It is Shevchenko Day and a group of twenty people have come here with flowers to mark the poet's birthday. Russian police have come, too - with cameras. They are filming everyone, including us. In Russian Crimea, public expressions of Ukrainian pride attract special attention.\nNadia is an ethnic Russian, but she is wearing a small Ukrainian flag.\n\"In my soul, Crimea is still part of Ukraine,\" Nadia tells me. \"I'm here because this statue is the last symbol of Ukraine left in Crimea.\"\nA woman called Lidiya overhears our conversation. She is furious.\n\"It was the Russian Empress Catherine the Great who built up Crimea,\" says Lidiya sternly.\n\"Well, if you're going to bring up history, we could go right back to the days of the Crimean khans,\" retorts Nadia.\nLidiya switches to modern history.\n\"Three years ago America was planning to station soldiers in three schools in Sevastopol,\" she claims. \"Nato troops wanted to be in Sevastopol. Crimea would have been wiped from the face of the earth.\"\n\"How do you know that?\" I ask.\n\"I read it in the internet,\" she replies.\n\"Does that make it true?\"\nLidiya changes tack.\n\"If people think they live badly in Crimea today, let them go and live in the Donbass in eastern Ukraine. They will be crying to come back here.\"\nWe drive to the town of Bakhchysarai in central Crimea to meet Umer Ibragimov. Umer, a Crimean Tatar, is desperate for information about his son Ervin. In May 2016 Ervin was abducted late at night. CCTV cameras caught the moment he was seized by men in uniform and bundled into a vehicle.\n\"I've written to everyone asking for help,\" Umer tells me, \"from the bottom levels right up to the president. But there has been no information about my son.\"\nErvin Ibragimov was a member of the executive board of the World Congress of Crimean Tatars. Since annexation, the Crimean Tatar community has come under pressure. Its elected representative body, the Mejlis, which had opposed the 2014 referendum on joining Russia, has been ruled an \"extremist organisation\" and banned.\nHuman rights group Amnesty International accuses the Russian authorities of \"systematic persecution\" of Crimean Tatars. This month the European Union's foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini concluded that \"the rights of the Crimean Tatars have been gravely violated\". Moscow denies the accusations.\nOver piping hot tea, Umer tells me the story of his family. In World War Two, his father had fought in the Red Army.\n\"He was wounded and came home,\" Umer says. \"Ten days later, all Crimean Tatars were deported from their homeland.\"\nIt was Josef Stalin who had ordered the deportation - an act of collective punishment and paranoia. The Soviet dictator suspected Crimean Tatars of collaborating with the Nazis. More than 230,000 people were forced on to cattle trains and transported to Central Asia.\n\"My mother and father told me later they'd be given just 15 minutes to gather their belongings,\" recalls Umer.\nUmer grew up in Soviet Uzbekistan. Conscripted into the Soviet army in the late 1970s, he spent a year fulfilling his \"internationalist duty\" fighting in Afghanistan.\nUmer looks at a photograph of his missing son.\n\"There is no justice,\" he says.\nAnd yet this Crimean spring feels calmer than three years ago. While Russia and the West argue over sanctions, sovereignty and borders, it seems that most people here are just trying to get on with their lives, trying to adapt.\n\"Everything calmed down,\" artist Svitlana Gavrilenko says. \"Everyone who used to be 'pro' something - either pro-Russia or pro-Ukraine - everybody calmed down.\"\nThree years ago Svitlana had opposed annexation. Today her perspective has changed.\n\"A lot of small and medium-sized businesses fell apart after Russia came because they were all connected to Ukraine.  Now they have reconnected to Russia and China. If we become a part of Ukraine again, we will need to solve all this stuff again. Everyone's life is going to be screwed up again.\"\nIn the Black Sea resort of Yalta I find the promenade packed with people enjoying a seaside stroll in the sunshine. The sound of the waves crashing on the shore mixes with jazz chords from street musicians.  From the conversations, there is an overriding sense of a population desperate for peace.\n\"Many people in Crimea still love Ukraine,\" Rodion says. \"Russia and Ukraine are too similar, their peoples too inter-connected to feel bad about each other.\"\nRodion believes \"it's not completely impossible\" that Crimea would one day return to Ukrainian rule.\n\"Nobody ever imagined it would become a part of Russia,\" he says, though he resents Western leaders who demand the peninsula's return. \"Crimea is not just a thing to be given to one country or another. It's a place. It's the people who live here. It's history. It's many things that cannot be bought or inter-changed.\"\nSvitlana Gavrilenko believes that the changes that took place here three years ago are irreversible.\n\"I don't think Russia in its modern state, with Putin at the top, could ever give Crimea back,\" she tells me. \"They made so much effort to connect it. They suffered through all these sanctions just to have Crimea. Why would they give it back?\"",
        "output": "she says. \"People there are suffering so much. The war is still going on and we don't know when it will end. My sister is so unhappy there. She wants to come back to Crimea.\"\nNadezhda is grateful to Russia for \"bringing peace\" to Crimea. She admits she has no idea about the situation in eastern Ukraine. She says she's heard \"rumours. But she doesn't know much about it.\nAsked if she's happy with the situation in Crimea and believes life there is better since the annexation.\nFar from feeling they are in a state of war",

Inmarsat recently launched an I-5 series of satellites. These all operate in Ka.\nThe other big difference from the I-4s, and indeed the I-5s, will be the new satellites' architecture. They will be what are called \"all-electric\" spacecraft.\nThis means they will use an ion engine to manoeuvre themselves once they come off the top of the launch rocket.\nThis is normally done with a large chemical thruster, but a significant mass saving can be made if the final orbital positioning is done using an engine that spits out a stream of charged gas.\nSuch ion engines, although extremely efficient, do however take longer to achieve the task in hand, resulting in a delay of several months to get the satellite on-station.\nThe plus side for the satellite owner is that they can use the mass saving either to select a smaller, cheaper rocket or to add additional payload capability.\nJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos",

But it's rarely as speedy as in Natalie Bennett's case.\nThe Australian-born former Guardian journalist woke up on New Year's Day 2006 and decided she wanted to do something to change the world.\nAfter pondering her options (should she get involved with an NGO or the UN?) she joined the Green Party. Within six short years she had become its leader.\nThree years after that she was sharing a stage with the prime minister and other party leaders in a televised general election debate.\nHer sudden arrival on the frontline of British politics was all the more remarkable because she had never won an election, other than the one that had made her party leader.\nHer first aim when she took on the job was to insert the Green Party - routinely ignored or patronised by the mainstream media - into the national conversation.\nBut when media outlets finally began calling, on the back of a surge in support for the party, she sometimes found it difficult to get her message across in a suitably snappy way.\nHer vision for the party was to show how \"economic and environmental justice are indivisible\", she explains, \"the idea that tackling environmental problems isn't an add-on luxury\".\nIt was \"not a easy concept to get across\", she confesses. \"I still don't think I've got the 12 second soundbite. But I am going to keep working on it.\"\n\"It's a classic Shakespearean thing,\" she says of her struggles with the broadcast media. \"It's both my strength and my weakness that I answer the question.\"\nBut, she adds, \"when you get asked a stupid question, it's rather hard to know what to do at that point. And I guess I get tangled up in my desire to answer a question, even when it's a really stupid question\".\nDid she get asked a lot of stupid questions?\n\"Yes.\"\nAsked for an example, she ponders for a minute, before highlighting an interview with the BBC's very own John Humphrys, which led to her having \"to spend time, valuable peak time, explaining how the interviewer got the question wrong. And listeners don't particularly like that because it's all technical and boring and you are arguing with the interviewer but if it's entirely on the wrong track you have to\".\nShe says she has some sympathy with Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who has also attracted criticism for broadcast interviews in which he has deviated from the usual prepared soundbites.\n\"The focus on the individual is a problem for British politics and it's very uncomfortable when the focus is on you,\" she says, arguing that the media in continental Europe are focused more on policies than personalities and trivia.\n\"I am not complaining - you have to work within those limits,\" she adds, but she believes British politics is \"broken\" and the media must take its share of the blame.\n\"There should be some pressure on the journalist to ask better, more sensible questions,\" she argues.\nThere was nothing particularly stupid about the question that prompted her darkest moment in a radio studio, however, when she struggled over several excruciating minutes, punctuated by coughing fits, to answer a question from LBC's Nick Ferrari on her party's housing policy.\nShe was quick to hold her hands up afterwards, apologising to supporters and blaming her sub-par performance, in the heat of the general election campaign, on \"brain freeze\".\n\"That was a very tough moment. And of course you take a bit of a punch to the stomach.\n\"But then a few weeks later I was up on the leader debates, able to look David Cameron in the eye and challenge him about his failure to welcome Syrian refugees to Britain, and that was one of the best moments.\n\"My great problem on that day was that I was in no way well enough to actually be doing anything. I'd had about three and a half hours sleep and I'd been throwing up most of the night. I should have just pulled the day but that's partly a function of how we got to that point.\n\"We weren't used to getting a lot of media attention and it was very, very hard to turn media attention down.\"\nOne of Ms Bennett's proudest moments came at the end of the BBC leaders debate when she joined Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood and Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon in a \"group hug\", while Labour leader Ed Miliband looked on awkwardly.\nThis felt like a watershed moment for women in politics, she says, sending out the message \"that politics can not just be 'dog eat dog', it can be people agreeing on some things and disagreeing on others but supporting each other\".\nAs a lifelong feminist, she is particularly pleased to have been told by \"lots of young women\" that they had been inspired by the \"group hug\", which she stresses had not been planned in advance.\n\"I hope and think that that moment really, in 15 years' time, 20 years' time, we might see a whole crop of MPs down the road who will reference that moment as the time they decided they were going to try and get there.\"\nMs Bennett's decision to pitch for the anti-austerity vote, positioning the Greens as a left-wing alternative to what was then Ed Miliband's Labour Party, struck a chord with idealistic young people who felt alienated by mainstream politics, and led to a surge in party membership.\nBut then Jeremy Corbyn came along and shifted Labour firmly to the left, inspiring idealistic activists to join his party in numbers the Greens could only dream about.\nHasn't the Green Party, which had a mixed set of results in May's elections, losing four councillors in England and failing to make progress in Wales but getting its best ever result in London, been crowded out of the picture by Labour?\nMs Bennett insists this is not the case, arguing that there is a \"very clear distinction\" between the Greens and Labour on a range of issues - from nuclear weapons to fracking - and that voters know exactly what they are getting when they vote Green.\nBut she is also open to the idea of a \"progressive alliance\" at the next general election, with local Green Parties potentially making electoral pacts with Labour, Plaid Cymru, the SNP or other parties who broadly share their outlook.\nShe remains a passionate advocate of electoral reform. The Green Party fielded a record number of general election candidates in 2015, standing in 93% of constituencies, and gaining more than a million votes. By rights, she argues, the party should have 25 MPs. She believes the case for scrapping what she sees as Britain's outdated first-past-the-post electoral system is gaining ground in the country.\nShe says she has had an \"amazing\" four years as leader, and has no regrets, believing the party is in better shape now, having quadrupled its membership and gained a foothold in the national debate on issues such as welfare and the economy, than when she took over.\nBut she is also keen to stress that she will not be leaving politics.\n\"I'm aiming to turn former leader into a role in its own right, to keep travelling the country, supporting local parties, doing media. Leadership is a role we can share around. It's not you become leader, that's the pinnacle, and then you disappear.\"\nAsked if she has any advice for the next leader, she says trust the party membership.\nAnything else?\n\"Work out how to answer stupid questions,\" she laughs. \"I still don't quite know the answer to that one myself.\"",

Illegal parking in the UK is a civil offence, so councils cannot request drivers' names and addresses from their home countries. In contrast, illegal parking is a criminal offense in France and some other European countries. Patrick Troy from the British Parking Association stated that local authorities do not have the means to enforce fines against foreign registered vehicles in the same way they do against UK registered vehicles, and argued that the government should negotiate reciprocal arrangements with the European Union.",

Many had become lawyers and doctors, or owned small businesses.\nTheir prosperity, further fuelled by racism, soon triggered anti-Japanese sentiment in Peru, Stephanie Moore explains.\nMs Moore, a scholar at the Japanese Peruvian Oral History Project, says after the outbreak of World War Two, the Japanese community in Peru became a target, and their assets were confiscated.\n\"In May 1940, as many as 600 houses, schools and businesses belonging to citizens of Japanese descent were burned down,\" she says.\nFollowing Japan's 1941 attack on the US naval base at Pearl Harbor in Hawaii, the US government asked a dozen Latin American countries, among them Peru, to arrest its Japanese residents.\nRecords from the time suggest the US authorities wanted to take them to the US and use them as bargaining chips for its nationals captured by Japanese forces in Asia.\nMr Katsura was among the 2,200 Latin Americans of Japanese descent who were forcibly deported to internment camps in the US.\nBlanca Katsura, who is now 83 and lives in Northern California, remembers how she learned of his fate.\n\"A month after my father was detained, he sent me a letter because it was my birthday,\" she recalls.\n\"He had been taken to Panama from where they were planning to send him to the US,\" she adds.\nSix months later, Blanca Katsura's mother decided to take her three small children to the US to search for her husband.\n\"When we arrived in New Orleans after a month-long trip, they confiscated our passports and then sent us by train to the Crystal City camp.\"\nAs many as 4,000 people were interned during World War Two in this camp in Texas run by the US Immigration and Naturalization Service.\nMost of the detainees were of Japanese descent, although some German and Italian immigrants were also held there.\nIt was at Crystal City that Blanca Katsura was reunited with her father. \"I was shocked, he had lost so much weight,\" she remembers.\nFor the next four years, her family lived in the barracks at the camp.\nHer memories of that time are not particularly traumatic, she says.\n\"Being a child at the time time, I had no worries and made lots of friends.\n\"We were able to go to school and learn Japanese,\" she adds.\nMs Katsura says she later learned that the camp authorities were keen for the children to learn Japanese so they would be able to speak the language once they were deported to Japan.\nChieko Kamisato's memories of life at Crystal City are less positive.\n\"You could call it a concentration camp, because we were surrounded by barbed wire fences and guards with guns,\" she says.\n\"We couldn't go out at all, although we were free to move around inside,\" she recalls.\n\"My parents were really bitter about the situation because they were forced to come to the US.

In fact, anger is at the peak right now.\"\nDespite a relatively strong economy and a string of financial incentives announced by Beijing to boost popular support in the semi-autonomous city, Hong Kong is a much more restive place than it was five years ago, when Mr Hu last came to visit, in a blaze of pre-Olympic glory.\nAhead of the visit, Hong Kong's census bureau publicised data that showed inequality had widened to its highest level in three decades.\nAccording to US government rankings, Hong Kong's wealth gap now outstrips all other developed nations. It ranks behind highly unequal countries such as Colombia, Haiti and Sierra Leone.\nMonthly incomes for Hong Kong's poorest have fallen by about 8% over the past five years, while salaries for the richest have grown by about 25%, according to the newest census data.\nSze Lai Shan, a social worker with the Society for Community Organisation, said as a result of integration with the mainland, Hong Kong's economic structure had changed.\n\"The factories have moved to mainland China, and the government believes in the trickle-down theory where everyone benefits from overall economic development. So they have done little for the poor,\" she said during a visit to a cramped sub-divided flat.\nThe first-floor flat is in the shadow of the glitzy commercial district of Causeway Bay.\nInside two dozen people - mostly single middle-age or elderly men - reside in enclosed wooden bunks the size of a single bed.\nLocals call these coffin homes, because each is slightly larger than the size of a coffin. Rent ranges from HK$1,000 ($128, £83) to HK$1,400 per bunk.\nLee Chi Wai, a 57-year-old cleaner with a warm smile, lives with his worldly possessions - a tiny television, a few compact disks, some plastic shelves and several shirts - directly below Wong Ching Po, 60.\nWhen not working, the two men watch television and engage in friendly banter. Both decry the lack of opportunities and inadequate public housing in Hong Kong.\n\"It's very hard to find a job,\" said Mr Lee. \"Most companies have moved to China. Those that stay want temporary workers not permanent staff. When the contract is over, I have to look for another job. That is why life is hard.\"\nFollowing the release of the census figures, Hong Kong's incoming Chief Executive CY Leung - who is to be sworn in on Sunday - announced he would chair a new preparatory task force to tackle poverty.\nBesides anger over social inequality, Mr Hu will be greeted by two large-scale democracy protests over the weekend.\nThe rally on Sunday is the annual human rights demonstration that traditionally starts at Victoria Park and ends at the Hong Kong government office in Admiralty.\n\"Hong Kong people are very uptight about freedom issues on the mainland, because they reflect on us. If not today, then tomorrow. If it's not in Hong Kong's present, it's going to reflect on our future,\" said Claudia Mo, a member of the Civic Party.\nLast year more than 200,000 people took part. This year organisers hope the crowd will be even larger because Hong Kong residents feel the Chinese government is becoming more, not less, corrupt and repressive.\nThe other rally on Saturday, due to finish at the Hong Kong Exhibition Centre in Wanchai, is timed to coincide with Mr Hu's dinner plans.\nProtesters will demand a reversal of the official verdict on Tiananmen Square, currently branded a counter-revolutionary activity, and a thorough investigation into the death of Mr Li, the elderly, disabled Chinese activist.\nMr Li's suspicious death in early June in central China sparked outrage in Hong Kong. Chinese officials have promised a proper investigation, but Hong Kong people remain sceptical.\nAlthough Mr Hu's visit in 2007 coincided with pro-democracy protests, the political climate in China and Hong Kong was different at that time.\nFive years ago, China seemed relatively open to democratic reform, as it promised organisers who awarded Beijing the 2008 games.\nRestrictions were eased for foreign and Hong Kong journalists. Activists such as AIDS campaigner Hu Jia and pro-democracy campaigner Liu Xiaobo were given relative free rein to air their views.\nThe country appeared to be edging ever so slightly closer to Hong Kong's core democratic values of clean government, the rule of law and freedom of speech.\nBut this year the political atmosphere is strained as Mr Hu arrives bearing financial incentives to drum up public support. He is expected to stay until Sunday.",

And the animation he displayed whenever his team got the ball was matched by his passion for the EU.\n\"I've got really good Spanish friends. Obviously, I feel English and British first, then I feel European,\" he says.\nWhat worries Brian is that Britain might now vote to leave the European Union.\n\"If I decided to up sticks, I could go to Portugal or France. But if Britain decides to leaveâ€¦ that may change.\"\nNo-one knows how many British people are, like Brian, long-term residents in Spain; the number is thought to be anywhere between 300,000 and 700,000.\nBut the British government has warned that two million British expats in Europe could be adversely affected in the event of an Out vote. Their right to free healthcare and their basic right to work could both be jeopardised, a Cabinet Office report says.\nCampaigners to leave the European Union have dismissed the report's findings as \"scaremongering\", part of what they see as a long-term strategy by the government which they have dubbed \"project fear\". It aims, they say, to persuade voters to stick with what they know and remain inside the EU.\nBut fears about leaving the EU are all too real, as far as Christine Rowlands is concerned. She's the chairwoman of the Costa del Sol branch of Conservatives Abroad, and insists that the party locally is united in wanting to remain inside the EU, unlike her political counterparts back home.\n\"It's not just about the money,\" she insists. \"Our friends are Danish, German, Spanish. It's about a united Europe.\"\nAsked what she makes of the Conservative debate on Europe back home in Britain, Christine giggles a little mischievously. \"It's like a children's playground,\" she says.\nThere is certainly a stark contrast here with the situation back home, where local Conservative Associations are perceived mainly to be of a Eurosceptic bent.\nBut in fact, there are plenty of Eurosceptic opinions to be heard on the Costa del Sol if you listen to the local English language radio station, Talk Radio Europe, and particularly its weekly phone-in show Viewpoint. It recently devoted a whole edition to the EU referendum, prompting many callers to sound off against the EU and all its works.\nDavid Cameron was denounced for fighting to keep Britain in, while Boris Johnson was praised for his \"courage\" in joining the Out camp. \"We did not vote for federalism, we voted for a common market,\" protested one listener.\nViewpoint's presenter is Richard Tildesley, a man with his ear very much glued to the ground when it comes to political opinion among expats. And he believes that living on the European mainland has put many people off the EU, however cosmopolitan their lives.\nThey are not impressed by how EU funds are spent, he believes, thinking the money is wasted on unnecessary projects while neglecting problems that badly need sorting out. Tildesley also argues that expats see the EU as destroying the very aspects of Spanish life that originally drew them to the country.\n\"What they perceive being created at the moment is a rather bland, pan-European homogenised culture.\"\nGiven the strength of opinion on this subject, it is perhaps surprising that so few expats in Spain have actually registered to vote, either in the forthcoming referendum, or indeed for any British elections.\nBritish citizens who leave the country are entitled to vote, providing they have been away for less than 15 years. But so far, only 11,000 people from the hundreds of thousands in Spain are on course to make use of this right.\nThe British embassy in Spain has launched a campaign to persuade British expats to register for the vote, a campaign that is being mirrored in countries across the world. It will use Facebook and Twitter to get its message across, but the embassy will also work with local Anglican churches, charities and any other organisations where expats are found.\n\"Registration of expat voters is fairly low across the world,\" British ambassador Simon Manley complains. Like any good diplomat, he gives no hint of his own view on the UK's membership of the EU, but he is passionate about the need for more voter engagement.\n\"The referendum is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to determine the future of our country. Whatever their views, wherever they live, I think it's important people exercise that right to vote.\"\nFor more on this story listen to Paul Moss's report on The World Tonight.",

His government plans to get tens of thousands of people to perform yoga in the heart of the capital on Sunday.\nMr Modi is an enthusiast himself - he told a biographer he tries to do yoga for an hour after waking up in the morning.\nSo what does Sunday's mass yoga session tell us about India?\nMr Modi's plan to get 35,000 people to perform yoga for 35 minutes on the stately Rajpath (King's Avenue) is aimed at setting a new Guinness World Record. The Guinness people have been invited to document the largest yoga class at a single venue.\nIndians already flaunt a number of yoga-related world records: the largest yoga class, longest yoga chain, longest yoga marathon and longest yoga class at multiple venues.\nInspired by Mr Modi's call, even India's National Cadet Corps want to set another record on Sunday - \"the largest ever demonstration of yoga by a uniformed organisation on a single day concurrently at multiple venues all across India\". It says a million cadets will simultaneously do yoga at 1,900 locations.\nYes, we are crazy about breaking world records.\nA reality check: Indians applied for some 3,000 records with Guinness World Records in 2013, just behind record-seekers from the US and Britain. The number of Indian record holders has risen an astonishing 250% in the past five years.\nIt helps that we are the world's second-most populous nation, so we have also set records in things like the biggest blood donation drive and most number of people shaking hands. Writer Samanth Subramanian describes this as a \"fevered subculture of record-setters\".\nIf a place in the Guinness World Records looks remote, no worries. We have our thriving, home-grown Limca Book of World Records and India Book of Records to take care of our achievements.\nBut Mr Modi, clearly, has set his sights higher.\nMore seriously, Sunday's gathering is a timely reminder that urban Indians need to get fitter.\nDoctors say India's cities are riding a diabetes and heart disease epidemic. India's diabetes rate jumped an alarming 123% between 1990 and 2013, compared to 45% worldwide, a new study found. One in four Indians die of heart disease. Obesity is on the rise.\nAs the middle class swells and grows richer, more Indians are leading desk-bound, sedentary work lives and enduring stressful commutes in pedestrian-unfriendly cities, where there is no culture of walking. Gorging on junk food and fat-rich diets doesn't help matters.\nIf Mr Modi's move encourages more Indians to take to yoga - with or without the spirituality attached to it - it would have served a purpose in making more Indians healthier.\nThe moment Mr Modi's government unveiled its mega yoga plans, political rivals cried foul.\nMayawati, the feisty leader of India's Dalits (formerly known as untouchables) said Mr Modi's party and its hardline allies were trying to use yoga to \"vitiate communal harmony\".\nThe main opposition Congress party has taken pot-shots at the event, and a senior party spokesperson issued a snarky broadside:\nSome Muslim clerics are uneasy about the government's motives and equate Mr Modi's government's promotion of yoga with promoting Hinduism. A recent story by Reuters was headlined: PM Modi's yoga offensive gets Muslims stressed.\nFirebrand ruling BJP MP Yogi Adityanath fanned the flames by saying that those who opposed the surya namaskar - a series of yoga positions designed to greet Surya, the Hindu Sun God - \"should drown in the sea\" - a remark that was swiftly put down by Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj.\nThe government has even taken out the sun salutation exercise from Sunday's performance, and is very keen to  showcase it as secular.\nPolitical analyst Neerja Chowdhury says Sunday's event serves the prime minister well. \"It's a win-win situation for Mr Modi. It boosts his image and keeps the hardliners happy,\" she told me.\nHowever, critics say Mr Modi's move comes at a time of rising anxiety among India's minorities, many of whom suspect that his party is trying to make India a pronouncedly Hindu nation.\nAnalyst Ajaz Ashraf says Mr Modi's yoga celebration is a \"mix of cultural nationalism, commercialisation and subtle coercion\". Historian Dilip Simeon decries what he calls the \"deceitful polemic about yoga\" and says Indians will learn yoga not to please Hindu nationalists, \"but for our health\".\n\"Yoga is part of ancient India's cultural heritage,\" says Manmohan Vaidya, a spokesperson of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), the hardline ideological godfather of the BJP and the largest Hindu nationalist group in India. \"By celebrating yoga on a mass scale we are validating our glorious past.\"\nOthers say yoga is India's biggest contribution to society after, perhaps, zero and is a symbol of its cultural richness.\nThere are concerns that India has lost control of \"brand yoga\" to the West - yoga is a multi-billion dollar industry worldwide - although Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj has said India would \"never like an Intellectual Property Rights stamp on yoga\".\nIs yoga essentially a religious activity? This BBC magazine piece has some answers. But closer to home, the Yoga Day is being seen by many as (Hindu) India \"reclaiming\" yoga.\nWendy Doniger, leading American academic and author of The Hindus: An Alternative History, says many Hindus, concerned about their image, fear that their religion has been stereotyped in the West as a polytheistic faith of \"castes, cows and curry\". They look at yoga as the poster-child of Indian spiritual wisdom and the essence of Hinduism.\nBut this, Doniger believes, ignores yoga's complex and contested history: there are at least five conflicting claims about when yoga began, including a provocative assertion by Mark Singleton that the roots of modern yoga actually do not lie in ancient India.\nThe transnational, Anglophone yoga, Singleton argues, derives from a curious mix of British body-building and physical culture, American transcendentalism, Christian science, naturopathy, Swedish gymnastics and the YMCA. Yoga's appeal grew far and wide. Even Fritz Lang made a film about trippy yogis.\nIn the end, as Doniger says, \"for some people yoga is a religious meditation, for others an exercise routine, and for others, both\".\n\"It is a rich, multi-cultural, interdisciplinary construction, far from the pure line that its adherents often claim for it.\"\nThere's no shortage of humour in India - and Sunday's event is no exception.\nI think sociologist Shiv Visvanathan puts it best. \"[Mr Modi] is looking for a new kind of cultural revolution. I like the comic part of it - the fat cops, the bureaucrats, doing exercise. Here is India, getting fat on hamburgers and milkshakes. Modi is the Benjamin Franklin of India in many ways,\" he told the New York Times.\nEven India's Home Minister Rajnath Singh has managed to encourage officials in his office to practice yoga after work, as he keeps a watchful eye on their moves:\nShripad Naik, the yoga minister, told the New York Times that yoga practice would help lower violent crime and produce better bureaucrats.\n\"There will be a definite change in the way the bureaucracy functions,\" he said. \"When they are thin, all their energy will go into producing better work.\"\nAnd popular yoga guru Baba Ramdev told a yoga rehearsal at a Delhi stadium last week that a yoga position would help \"rid the world of gas\".\nBut this man practising on the soggy rain-soaked field did not quite appear to be listening to the guru's exhortations to put on the world's best yoga show on Sunday.",

How can we trust what they say this time?\nThe weight given to the reports of the IPCC is a measure of the global scale of scientific involvement with the panel.\nDivided into three working groups that look at the physical science, the impacts and options to limit climate change, the panel involves thousands of scientists around the world.\nThe first report, to be presented in Stockholm, has 209 lead authors and 50 review editors from 39 countries.\nThe 30-page Summary for Policymakers that will be published after review by government officials in the Swedish capital is based on around 9,000 peer-reviewed scientific papers and 50,000 comments from the expert reviewers.\nBut among these icebergs of data, things can and do go awry.\nIn the last report, published in 2007, there were a handful of well publicised errors, including the claim that Himalayan glaciers would disappear by 2035. The wrong percentage was also given for the amount of land in the Netherlands under sea level.\nThe IPCC admitted it had got it wrong and explained that, in a report running to 3,000 pages, there were bound to be some mistakes. The Himalayan claim came from the inclusion of an interview that had been published in the magazine New Scientist.\nIn its own words, the IPCC is there \"to provide the world with a clear scientific view on the current state of knowledge in climate change and its potential environmental and socio-economic impacts\".\nThe offspring of two UN bodies, the World Meteorological Organization and the United Nations Environment Programme, it has issued four heavyweight assessment reports to date on the state of the climate.\nThese are commissioned by the governments of 195 countries, essentially the entire world. These reports are critical in informing the climate policies adopted by these governments.\nThe IPCC itself is a small organisation, run from Geneva with a full time staff of 12. All the scientists who are involved with it do so on a voluntary basis.\nIn 2009, a review of the way the IPCC assesses information suggested the panel should be very clear in future about the sources of the information it uses.\nThe panel was also scarred by association with the \"Climategate\" rumpus. Leaked emails between scientists working for the IPCC were stolen and published in 2009.\nThey purported to show some collusion between researchers to make climate data fit the theory of human-induced global warming more clearly. However at least three investigations found no evidence to support this conclusion.\nBut the overall effect of these events on the panel has been to make them more cautious.\nAlthough this new report is likely to stress a greater certainty among scientists that human activities are causing climate warming, in terms of the scale, level and impacts, the word \"uncertainty\" features heavily.\n\"What we are seeing now is that this working group is getting more careful than they already were,\" said Prof Arthur Petersen, chief scientist at the Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency.\n\"Overall, the message is, in that sense, more conservative I expect, for this IPCC report compared to previous ones.\"\nHasn't global warming stopped since 1998?\nThe 2007 IPCC report made no mention of any slowdown or standstill in temperature rises in recent decades. They pointed out that the linear warming trend over the previous 50 years was 0.13C per decade, which was twice that for the past 100 years.\nThey forecast that, if emissions of carbon dioxide continued on their existing path, over the next century the climate would respond by warming between 2C and 4.5C, with a most likely rise of 3C.\nBut since 2007, climate sceptics have loudly argued that global average temperatures haven't actually gone above the level recorded in 1998.\nThe issue is now being taken more seriously by the IPCC and other respected science organisations.\nMy colleague David Shukman summarised some of the explanations now being offered as to why the temperatures have not risen more quickly in line with the modelling.\nMost scientists believe that the warming has continued over the past 15 years, but more of the heat has gone into the oceans. They are unsure about the mechanisms driving this change in behaviour.\nThe most recent peer reviewed article suggested that a periodic, natural cooling of the Pacific Ocean was counteracting the impact of carbon dioxide.\n\"1998 was a particular hot year due to a record-breaking El Niño event, while recently we have had mostly the opposite - cool conditions in the tropical Pacific,\" Prof Stefan Rahmstorf, from the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany, told BBC News.\n\"That warming has not stopped can be seen from the ongoing heat accumulation in the global oceans.\"\nClimate sceptics, however, argue that the pause is evidence that climate models used by the IPCC are too sensitive and exaggerate the effects of carbon dioxide.\n\"In the last year, we have seen several studies showing that climate sensitivity is actually much less than we thought for the last 30 years,\" said Marcel Crok, a Dutch author who is sceptical of the IPCC process.\n\"These studies show that our real climate has a sensitivity of between 1.5C and 2.0C. But the models are much more sensitive, and warm up three degrees.\"\nAm I going to get flooded?\nThe 2007 IPCC report was heavily criticised for its estimations on sea level rise.\nThe panel suggested that a warming planet would see waters around the world rise by between 18cm and 59cm by the end of this century. Heat causes the seas to expand but also increases the rate of melting of glaciers and ice sheets.\nThe IPCC doesn't commission any new science, but reviews and condenses existing peer reviewed material.\nEach Summary for Policymakers is a short distillation of an underlying report that can stretch to several hundred pages. The final draft of the short summary is presented to representatives of the 195 governments who commission the report.\nIn a hectic week before publication, every single line is gone through by the scientists and civil servants. The lead authors are in the room and can veto a change if it isn't supported in the underlying report.\nThe IPCC figure didn't include any estimates for the extra water coming from the Greenland or Antarctic ice sheets as they said they didn't have enough accurate information.\nOther researchers were critical of this approach and have published studies that suggested a far higher sea level rise.\nBut in recent months, a study funded by the European Union and involving scientists across the world, came up with what they believe is the most accurate estimate yet - and it increases the level of sea rise by just 10cm from the IPCC report.\n\"What we are talking about is a reduction in uncertainty - we find we haven't changed the number enormously compared to AR4 (IPCC 2007 report),\" said Prof David Vaughan, from the British Antarctic Survey (Bas), while speaking at the launch of the report.\n\"We've added maybe another 10cm but the level of certainty we have around that is actually higher than it was in the AR4.\"\nLeaked details from the forthcoming report indicate that the worst sea level rise scenarios for the year 2100, under the highest emissions of carbon dioxide, could reach 97cm.\nSome scientists, including Prof Rahmstorf, have been unhappy with the models used by the IPCC to calculate the rise. Using what's termed a semi-empirical model, the projections for sea level can reach 2m. At that point, an extra 187 million people across the world would be flooded.\nBut the IPCC is likely to say that there is no consensus about the semi-empirical approach and will stick with the lower figure of just under 1m.\nSo will all this mean more flooding?\n\"Yes, but not everywhere,\" said Prof Piers Forster from the University of Leeds. \"Generally, the wet regions will get wetter and the dry ones drier.\"\nThe report is also likely to assess the intensity of storms, and there might be some better news in that there is likely to be a downwards revision.\nAnd what about the Polar bears?\nThe state of the North and South Poles has been of growing concern to science as the effects of global warming are said to be more intense in these regions.\nThe IPCC has evolved a complicated way of communicating scientific certainty and confidence in a finding:\nvery unlikely - 0-10%\nunlikely - 10-33%\nlikely as not - 33-66%\nlikely - 66-100%\nvery likely - 90-100%\nExtremely likely - 95-100%\nVirtually certain - 99-100%\nConfidence is also expressed as very low, low, medium, high and very high.\nEvidence can can be limited, medium or robust.\nAnd levels of agreement can be low, medium or high\nIn 2007, the IPCC said that temperatures in the Arctic increased at almost twice the global average rate in the past 100 years. They pointed out that the region can be highly variable, with a warm period observed between 1925 and 1945.\nIn the drafts of the latest report, the scientists say there is stronger evidence that ice sheets and glaciers are losing mass and sea ice cover is decreasing in the Arctic.\nIn relation to Greenland, which by itself has the capacity to raise global sea levels by six metres, the panel says they are 90% certain that the average rate of ice loss between 1992 and 2001 has increased six-fold in the period 2002 to 2011.\nWhile the Arctic mean sea ice extent has declined by around 4% per decade since 1979, the Antarctic has increased up to 1.8% per decade over the same time period.\nAs for the future, the suggestions are quite dramatic. Under the worst carbon emissions scenarios, an Arctic free of sea ice in the summer by the middle of this century is likely.\nSome recent newspaper reports have suggested that sea ice in the Arctic has recovered in 2013, but scientists are virtually certain about the trend.\n\"The sea ice cover on the Arctic ocean is in a downward spiral,\" said Prof Rahmstorf. \"And much faster than IPCC predicted.\"\nAnd Prof Shang-Ping Xie from the University of California in San Diego told BBC News that the outlook for polar bears and other species isn't good.\n\"There will be pockets of sea ice in some marginal seas. Hopefully, polar bears will be able to survive summer on these pockets of remaining sea ice,\" he said.\nDoes the IPCC have a future?\nThere have been growing calls for reform of the IPCC process from critics and friends alike.\nMany believe that these big, blockbuster reports, published once every six years, are not the way forward in the modern era.\n\"The close government scrutiny and infrequent publication certainly fillip the climate change agenda,\" said Prof Forster.\n\"But, given the pace of both science and news, perhaps it is time the IPCC moved with the Twitter generation.\"\nMany sceptical voices are also calling for changes.\nMarcel Crok says the whole process of the IPCC is bad for the scientific principle of open argument.\n\"It is not designed to answer questions because the whole IPCC process, the whole consensus-building process, is choking the openness of the scientific debate,\" he explained.\nHowever, some argue the IPCC plays an important role as a source of information for developing countries.\nAnd again others think the organisation will survive for far more unprincipled reasons. \"It is a UN body,\" said Prof Petersen. \"It may perpetuate until eternity.\"\nFollow Matt on Twitter.",

Many here view the use of the Ukrainian language as central to the country's identity.\nThey believe that - after centuries of Russian and Soviet hegemony - to be a true Ukrainian, one must speak Ukrainian.\nAnything less is to surrender to the country's one-time cultural and political masters in Moscow - where many still view Ukraine as a Russian appendage - and ultimately threatens the country's continued independence.\n\"This law is sending an incredibly powerful signal that the Ukrainian language is not needed,\" said Roman Tsupryk, a political commentator and chairman of the editorial board of the Ukrainian weekly \"Tyzhden\" (Week).\n\"People don't see the mechanism behind it, but they will see the consequences in a year or a year and half.\"\nPeople in the country's Russian-speaking east and south have a predictably different view on the matter.\nThey say that they are patriotic Ukrainians - just ones that speak another language - and they simply wish to have the right to speak their native tongue in courts, government offices and schools, as the new legislation stipulates.\nThey also bristle at the accusation - especially in the country's west, where Ukrainian is predominantly spoken - that they are any less Ukrainian than the rest of the country.\n\"I speak Russian - what's the big problem?\" said Ruslan, a taxi driver in the eastern city of Donetsk, who asked to use only his first name.\n\"Why do people in the west get to say who is Ukrainian and who isn't?\"\nGiven the intense emotions on either side of the language debate, however, the question arises why President Viktor Yanukovych's ruling Party of Regions chose this moment to stir up this particular hornet's nest?\nSome analysts believe the new language law is an opening salvo in the government's campaign for parliamentary elections in October.\nThe law, touching on a cultural hot button, they say, serves a dual purpose - it distracts the electorate from more pressing issues like Ukraine's continued economic slump, and it riles up the political \"base.\"\n\"Every time we have elections, the issue of language is there,\" said Oleh Rybachuk, a cabinet member in the previous government and now an independent analyst.\n\"Language is not so important - it is not among the top 15 priorities of the people. But for some reason, every time we have elections, we have that issue.\"\nAccording to Mr Rybachuk, however, opposition politicians also welcome this issue, since it allows them to mobilise their own constituency. But this could have disastrous consequences.\n\"This kind of cementing of constituencies really divides the country,\" he says, adding that the unrest \"creates space for radicals from both side.\"\n\"It's easy to provoke a conflict, to shed blood,\" he adds.\nGranted, not all of Ukraine is divided into two opposing camps - and it remains to be seen how this pro and anti-Russian stand-off will play out among the rest of the population.\nA short, informal survey around the capital Kiev, a city which speaks both Russian and Ukrainian, yielded (tentatively) some unpredictable results.\nA number of native Russian speakers said that they were against giving Russian official status. They felt that ultimately Ukrainian should be the country's dominant mode of communication.\nWhile Ukrainian speakers said that they did not oppose giving Russian a more elevated status.\n\"Ukrainian will win out in the end,\" said Svitlana, a native Ukrainian speaker who supported the new legislation.\nWhether the law becomes a reality is still an open question, however.\nIn order for it to enter into force, it needs to be signed by the parliament speaker, who has tendered his resignation in protest over its passing, and President Yanukovych.\nThe Ukrainian leader said that he would reach a decision after he \"studied all questions\" relating to the legislation.",

They will have a go at Claudio Ranieri's side, which of course plays into their hands.\nOn their day, Arsenal's free-flowing football is good enough to destroy anyone and it does not matter who they play at the back.\nHowever, they looked fragile with Chambers and Holding playing together and there was definitely a lack of confidence in their defence, which is why Koscielny has to return this time. I would be amazed if he doesn't.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nKoscielny is not injured, just being rested after returning to training late after Euro 2016 and, even if he is only 80% fit, I would play him.\nIn his position, he does not have to cover as much ground as other outfield players and he could get through the game.\nAs a player, if I was in his situation I would be hammering on the manager's door saying, 'you need me, I can play, stick me in'.\nBut maybe he is saying that, and Wenger is still not picking him because he thinks he is not ready physically. If that is the case Wenger will have to take responsibility if things go wrong again.\nArsenal played a high-pressing game in the first half against Liverpool but they could not sustain that tempo for 90 minutes - it is virtually impossible for any team.\nWhen the Gunners stopped doing it, in the second half at Emirates Stadium, they conceded a flurry of goals but very rarely will they come up against a team that plays so well for such an intense period of a game.\nYes, Arsenal could have defended better, kept their shape better and played more percentage football but Liverpool's performance in that 20-minute spell was pretty sensational and they scored some absolutely brilliant goals.\nSo I don't think Wenger will be overly concerned that will happen to his team every week, and he certainly will not be worried about it against Leicester. I don't think Arsenal will try to press the Foxes in the same way.\nI would imagine he and the Arsenal players believe they can go to the King Power Stadium, dominate the ball and cause more problems than the Foxes can cause them.\nThey did it last season, when they won 5-2, and they will think that once again they have more quality on the pitch so they will create more chances and be able to win the game playing that way too.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nLeicester also lost last week, going down to a surprise defeat at Hull.\nBut I did not read too much into the Foxes' poor performance because their defence was missing Robert Huth, whose organisation and presence was absolutely pivotal in their title win.\nHuth is back from his ban on Saturday and he might not be the only familiar face back in Ranieri's starting XI.\nAgainst Hull, he left out Marc Albrighton and Shinji Okazaki from the team that played almost every game last season.\nI understand why he did it - because he is trying to move his team forward - but it is hard to do that while retaining the same ethos that brought them their success.\nThey will be desperate for three points from their first home game of the season, and a tried and tested line-up might be the way to get it. They are likely to return to their regular way of playing too.\nLeicester only had more possession than their opponents in five of their 38 league games last season, but they had marginally more of the ball than Hull last weekend - 50.3%.\nThe Tigers sat deep and did not allow them to play to their strengths on the break but against Arsenal the game is far more likely to follow a pattern that suits Ranieri's fast attackers.\nI also think Leicester have to be careful not to believe their own hype now they are champions, start to over-play and forget their strengths.\nIt can easily happen - I played in teams where we did that when we just won a few games in a row, for example at Fulham when we were on a good run and got a bit confident.\nWe still had Bobby Zamora up top, who we could play long to, get the ball into his chest and play off him but at times he would be screaming at us to give him the ball because we would be passing it around at the back thinking we were a good side.\nAll of a sudden teams were pressing us, nicking the ball and causing us problems, and we had to rethink, and remember what was getting us results.\nLeicester have bright players and a clever manager so I do not see that being a massive issue for them, especially on Saturday. Arsenal will come at them and leave space behind their defence for them to pump it up there for Jamie Vardy to get in the channels and cause havoc.\nThis is a big game for Vardy, against the team he turned down over the summer.\nHe was visibly frustrated at missing the chances he got against Hull and, facing Arsenal, he will be determined to prove a point and show them why they wanted him.\nThere is the chance the circumstances mean he could try a little bit too hard to make things happen instead of just playing naturally but it will be hard to tell because he looks like he gives absolutely everything in every game anyway.\nI actually thought he was a bit unlucky not to score against Hull because he was only denied by a tremendous block.\nYes, he also blazed one shot over the bar which is unlike him but he set himself ridiculously high standards last season and it will be very difficult for him to maintain that ratio.\nIt is the same for any striker, and can happen for a variety of reasons but I do not see it becoming an issue for Vardy because the way he plays and the way his team plays means he is always going to get chances, including against Arsenal.\nThe occasion is set up for him and, the way he is, it certainly would not surprise me if he goes and bangs in the winner.\nDanny Murphy was speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.",
        "output": "Arsenal need to fix their defense, especially with Laurent Koscielny returning from injury. They played young duo Calum Chambers and Rob Holding in their last game, which didn't work out well. The team needs to be careful not to let their success from last season affect their approach this season. Leicester, Arsenal's opponent, lost their last game but returns Robert Huth to their defense, which could help them. Leicester might struggle with over-confidence and need to stay humble. Jamie Vardy, Leicester's striker, needs to prove a point against Arsenal, but he might try too hard. Vardy was unlucky not to score against Hull and, facing Arsenal, he will be determined to show them why they wanted him. The match is set up for him, and it wouldn't surprise if he scored the winner.",

They echoed the aspirations and struggles of the blue-collar worker.\nIn the words of critic Bob Allen, Haggard, above all, succeeded in \"capturing in metaphor the bleary-eyed angst and dark revelations of the soul that lie beyond the second six-pack\".\nIn the 1970s, he was the scourge of liberal America with songs like Okie from Muskogee, which poked fun at hippies and the anti Vietnam war movement, and the deeply patriotic Fightin' Side of Me, a love-America-or leave-it anthem.\nHaggard's early life is the stuff of legend. His family migrated from the dust-bowl of Oklahoma to Bakersfield, California where Merle was born in 1937.\nHis father died when Merle was nine, and his devout Christian mother was unable to control him. The young Merle became a teenage tearaway, hopping freight trains, working in orchards and oil fields, and getting mixed up in petty crime.\nHe was sent to, and escaped from, a variety of penal institutions. He wound up serving nearly three years in San Quentin for burglary and escape.\nHe was subsequently pardoned by the then governor of California, Ronald Reagan, whom he later befriended.\nHaggard married a waitress, Leona Hobbs, at 17, with whom he had four children over a 10-year period. He was behind bars when the first two were born.\nA love of singing and a concert by Johnny Cash, in 1958, inspired him to join the prison band. Songs from his experience inside include Sing Me Back Home, Branded Man and Mama Tried.\nHis first number one hit came with I'm a Lonesome Fugitive in 1966. He achieved great popularity with an album of love songs recorded with his second wife, Bonnie Owens.\nIn the late 1960s, Haggard enjoyed success with several country classics, including I Take a Lot of Pride in What I Am, and Silver Wings. His song Today I Started Loving You Again has been recorded by more than 400 singers.\nThe bleakness of recession-hit America was perfectly expressed in If We Make It Through December which provided Haggard with his only significant pop hit.\nBetween 1973 and 1976, he achieved nine straight number one country singles. His struggle with alcohol inspired Swinging Doors and The Bottle Let Me Down. It also led to divorce, his second of three.\nHaggard's voice, wide-ranging both dynamically and emotionally, lent itself well to interpreting other people's material too.\nHe recorded tributes to such giants as Jimmie Rodgers, Bob Wills and Elvis Presley. He was a fine guitarist and even played the fiddle well.\nBy 1990, Merle Haggard had notched up 95 country hits including 38 number ones. Yet, within three years, he declared himself bankrupt.\nHe continued to tour, though the venues became smaller as the advent of \"new country\" saw traditional singers like Haggard become passÃ©.\nBut his final years saw a renaissance in his popularity, and his recent albums were well reviewed.\nIn 1996, Merle Haggard was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame and in 2010 he was honoured at the White House's 33rd annual national celebration of the arts.\nAfter making a full recovery from lung cancer he released another album, I am what I am in 2011.\nHis story is one of crime, punishment, alcoholism, and violence mixed with a love of music, religion and America.\nHe once said \"There's the guy I'd love to be and the guy I am. I'm somewhere in between, in deep water, swimming to the other shore.\"",

Not quite. However, what's left of it is now coming under considerable pressure.\nWe set out to visit one Tibetan community in Aba region.\nThis place came to world attention in recent years as the centre of a wave of self-immolation suicide protests. In Tibetan towns, nearly 150 people, mostly monks and nuns, set fire to themselves in protest at the impact of Beijing's rule - the largest number of them in Aba.\nFor this reason, security has been tight in the area for years. But, as the self-immolations have slowed, we hoped to be better able to reach remote communities and speak to people.\nThe central Chinese province of Sichuan - of which Aba is a district - is quintessential China. It's the home of pandas and spicy food.\nIf you look at a map its virtually in the middle of the country.\nYet if you drive out of the regional capital Chengdu and head west, it's not long before you enter another world. The road heads up and up until you reach the Tibetan Plateau.\nWhen people speak about Tibet they often mean what's called the Tibetan Autonomous Region (TAR). This is the area foreigners are not allowed to enter without special permission, where reporters are rarely granted access and, if they ever are allowed in, must be accompanied by a minder at all times.\nHowever, the massive area where ethnic Tibetans actually live is twice as big as the TAR, spreading out across the plateau and dipping into Yunnan, Qinghai, Gansu and Sichuan.\nOn arrival in what you might call the Tibetan zone we are quickly spotted by police.\nThe authorities have been expecting us. They know we have been in contact with locals trying to line up interviews and to prepare logistics for the trip. They have already sent messages back to us via these same locals saying we are not welcome, suggesting we go elsewhere.\nWe have barely unpacked when government officials arrive for a chat.\nWhat are we doing here? What are our plans?\nWe explain that we are here at this specific time to film the annual movement of herdsmen who will drive their yaks up into the hills where they will live for the summer months.\nThey listen, appear friendly enough and don't kick us out. But the next day when we speak to those preparing to make the journey, the government will have its people listening in.\nWe get up before the sun hits the grassland.\nThere are villages nearby and these days - during the freezing winter months at least - most people here live in fixed dwellings.\nFollowing a deliberate government policy of relocation, Tibetans have moved into the towns. Critics say this has been a control mechanism which allows the authorities to be able to track people more easily. The Communist Party says it was done to improve people's living standards, nothing more.\nSo, for much of the year, people have televisions, fridges and electrical lights. But when the summer comes they head for the hills - back to the land of their forebears.\n\"Nomads here are nomads to the bottom of our hearts,\" Kalsang Gyatso tells us. \"We lived like this from ancient times. Actually we don't like being in houses.\"\nWe meet him and other family members rounding up their yaks and pushing them into a pen. Soon they, like all their neighbouring herdsmen, will follow the same route as every year and drive their livestock into the mountains where the grass hasn't been touched for months.\n\"If we don't go to the summer grasslands and just stay in the winter fields there will be no food left for the yaks. When they have new grass to eat, our animals will grow fat and they'll produce enough milk.\"\nHe also tells us that the summer pastures have medicinal flowers which the yaks need to eat in order to stay healthy.\nThe government official who had been standing in the field and listening to our interview suddenly disappears. Perhaps he realised that our story really is about what we said it was about and that it's not hurting anyone to speak about these matters.\nNext to Kalsang Gyatso's place runs a recently laid tar road and along it the sound of hundreds of hooves can be heard. The migration is on!\nCars and trucks must part a sea of animals in order to get through. Most drivers just stop and wait for the beasts to pass.\nThe Tibetans are on horseback, calling and whistling to keep their livestock moving. Some of the yaks carry the bedding they'll need upon arrival as well as other bits and pieces for camping.\nOne young man speaks to us as he rides past. He says they must move now in order to make the most of new grass and provide for their families and that the dates for the journey are actually fixed by government regulations.\nI ask how he feels getting back to the old ways at least for a few months, expecting a description of the rich ancient culture again flowing through his veins. \"I'm a little bit tired,\" he says.\nAs we follow group after group heading further to the west we reachâ€¦ a grassland adventure park.\nIt is being built smack in the middle of the main migration route and has already been opened. Eventually this attraction will be able to handle thousands of tourists on any given day.\nWe watch as yaks in their hundreds are pushed through the car park, under the main gate, past the turnstiles and soon they are surrounding the tourist buses carrying ethnic Han Chinese travellers in search of an awe-inspiring Tibetan experience.\nChina's Tibetan areas have been hotbeds of rebellion in the past, with some blaming Beijing for restrictions on Tibetan Buddhism, language and culture.\nThe government's answer: development.\nWe board one of the buses and speak to those taking photos of the Tibetans riding along outside.\n\"Up here it's exactly the eating a mouthful of meat, drinking a mouthful of wine plateau feeling that I wanted,\" says one woman.\n\"It feels like another world. I feel stronger about Tibetan culture because Tibetans are purer and lead a more simple life,\" says another and her friend nods.\nThey seem to have genuine affection for the people who call this place home and inside the adventure park they will come into contact with the Tibetans who have been employed here.\nThe herding communities, however, are divided about whether the explosion in tourist numbers is such a good thing.\nEven the Tibetans who have opened small guest lodges with areas for camping are worried that their once pristine environment is gradually being overrun.\nTshe Bdag Skyabs has been travelling with his animals for two days.\n\"On the one hand, people's incomes have increased and transportation is more convenient,\" he says. \"But the environmental harm from development has been huge.\"\nEventually he, his family and 400 yaks pass the tourist park and the outer limit of modern existence.\nThey arrive at the untainted expanse of the high mountain grasslands.\nHere there are no shops, no roads, no tourists, but there is the space of their ancestors.\n\"When I make it here my mood is very good, exceptionally good,\" he tells us. \"When city people come here they will also feel happy because of the fresh air and the smell of wildflowers. It's like a fairyland.\"\nThey will stay here until September. They will walk with bare feet in order to preserve the flowers that their yaks need to eat. They will milk their animals to make butter tea and cheese. And when the weather starts getting cold, they'll head back down the mountain, to return again next year.\nWhen a traditional way of life collides with a massive influx of tourism it's always going to be good and bad.\nYou can only hope that the benefits outweigh any pitfalls.\nBut, when it comes to the grassland Tibetans - if what we have seen is anything to go by - despite everything that the modern world is throwing at them, their culture does appear to remain remarkably resilient.\nAt least, for these communities. At least, for the time being.",

Perhaps more shocking is that one quarter of those questioned in Iraq and more than one third in Syria think their country is actually on the right track.\n66%\nthink the country is going in the wrong direction\n90%\nbelieve a diplomatic solution to national differences can be found\n84% think Islamic State are a \"strongly negative\" influence\n56% Oppose coalition air strikes\nBut what is fascinating is that it was possible to conduct this opinion poll at all - especially given the continuing violence in Iraq and the chaos in war-torn Syria.\nJohnny Heald of ORB International said his company has been polling in Iraq every year since 2005, though he admits that the security situation is challenging in some governorates.\nThe Iraq poll is not nationally representative, he notes, since it was restricted to 10 of the 18 governorates, with no interviews conducted in the three Kurdish governorates or in some of the smaller Shia governorates.\nHe argues though that what gives his Syria poll credibility is the geographic distribution of those interviewed.\n\"In all polling the data is only as good as the sample upon which it is drawn,\" he told me. \"This data from Syria covers opinion throughout all 14 governorates across the country.\n\"So it includes those people living under the control of the regime, under the control of the so-called Islamic State [IS], [al-Qaeda affiliate] al-Nusrah, the wider opposition and the YPG [Kurdish fighters].\"\nMore than 14 supervisors and 40 interviewers travelled throughout the country to collect data.\n\"It starts with one week's training in southern Turkey where the supervisors come to Gaziantep and we go through the methodology, the questionnaire and the quality control procedures,\" Mr Heald said.\n\"We pilot the questionnaire before it is fielded. We then ensure we have the relative permits/permissions to operate and undertake a risk assessment.\"\nBut how do you set about conducting field research in an IS-controlled area?\n\"In the IS-controlled areas of Raqqa for each survey we visit the head of the town and ask him for permission to randomly interview people,\" Mr Heald says.\n\"His response is 'so long as you are not an international media station and pull out video cameras, I don't mind you doing this'.\"\n\"Why is this his reaction? Because, as the data verifies, many of those living in Raqqa now are happier since IS took over.\n\"They welcome the security, they see IS trying to help the people with electricity, with food, with petrol. In many respects it is a story they are keen to tell.\"\n57%\nthink the country is going in the wrong direction\n50%\noppose coalition air strikes\n48% said Islamic State are a \"strongly negative\" influence\n21% prefer life now compared to before the war\nThis perhaps surprising finding is one of the values of this kind of survey.\nAs Mr Heald said, the survey suggests that \"the majority in both countries are opposed to IS but that they also think that IS is a product of foreign countriesâ€¦ which to you and I may seem like some crazy conspiracy theory but to them it is a common perception.\n\"Widespread opposition to the coalition bombing, should also make policymakers reconsider their strategy. I think the official British government line is that coalition air strikes are 'degrading' IS.\n\"But while we can accept that it may be slowing them down,\" he says, \"there is little evidence to suggest they are losing the war. People aren't leaving Raqqa now because of IS - they are leaving because of the coalition air strikes.\"\nFor Western policymakers there is a lot to be gloomy about here.\nMore than one quarter of those questioned in Syria still see President Bashar al-Assad as exercising a strongly positive influence over the country. But the ORB survey does find some guarded grounds for optimism.\n\"Majorities in both Iraq and Syria, oppose the break up of their country,\" Mr Heald said. \"Majorities think that despite doctrinal differences they are stronger together than fighting each other. Self-identifying as an Iraqi or a Syrian is a preferred option to identifying as a Sunni or a Shia.\"\nBut what of the broader value of such opinion surveys? Mr Heald is a pollster so he is clearly not going to undermine his own business.\nBut he surely makes a valid point when he says: \"Policymakers need to understand public opinion in these countries. IS have an incredibly well-oiled strategic communication operation. Politicians and military leaders need to track public opinion to see where hearts and minds are and how they are shifting.\n\"There are also significant operations taking place in country - whether they be aid-related, messaging-related or kinetic (air strikes).

So Mr Cameron will point out that more than 90% of working households will be better off under the changes which come in today, largely due to the rise in the amount we can earn before we pay tax.\nLabour has countered that families are on average £1,100 a year worse off because of the tax and welfare changes since 2010; much of this is due to benefit cuts.\nDavid Cameron will say there is not just an economic case but a moral case for low taxes, saying this goes to the heart of what he believes in as a Conservative.\nBut in an apparent acknowledgement that many people do not yet feel they are benefitting from the upturn in the economy, he will say: \"I don't just want people to see Britain's recovery on the TV or hear it on the radio, I want them to feel it in their lives.\"\nHe'll claim that today's changes will help that to happen.\nFew of us want to hand over more of our earnings in taxes, but as we saw in last week's television debate, some of his political rivals are mounting strong arguments that taxes should be raised for higher earners.\nThere is another flipside to the commitment to low taxes.

But there remain big unanswered questions on which benefits and which government projects will have to be axed.\nLiberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg blasted Labour's policies as \"economically illiterate\", but also warned that Chancellor George Osborne was \"a very dangerous man\" because of his plan to balance the books by spending cuts alone.\nOne of the biggest changes coming into force on Monday is the relaxation of pension rules, so that those with a defined contribution pension \"pot\" can take out as much as they like when they reach the age of 55.\nLiberal Democrat Pensions Minister Steve Webb said the principle was to trust people with their own money - but he urged people to seek advice and not rush into any decisions.\nThis election issue includes income tax and national insurance levies and business taxes.\nLabour's pensions spokesman Gregg McClymont welcomed the \"flexibility\" in the new system but voiced concerns the pensions industry was \"finding it difficult to adapt so quickly to such a big change\".\nOther changes coming into effect include a higher limit on ISA savings, the Marriage Tax Allowance, a 2.5% increase in the state pension, the abolition of employer National Insurance on under 21-year-olds and the scrapping of the 10p tax band on savings. Working age benefit increases have also been capped at 1%.\nThe Conservatives have produced Treasury figures suggesting 94% of households will be better off under the changes, with 92% of pensioner households also gaining. The figures do not include workless households.\nIn his speech, Prime Minister David Cameron will say: \"Today is a big day for our country. It's 'money-back Monday' - a day when, quite simply, hardworking taxpayers get to keep more of their own cash.\"\nHe will add that as a result of Conservative action - including raising the personal allowance - \"our country becomes a better and fairer place to live… where those who put in, get out; where hard work is rewarded; and people are trusted.\"\nSubscribe to the BBC Election 2015 newsletter to get a round-up of the day's campaign news sent to your inbox every weekday afternoon.",

        "input": "Summarize the following article into nine sentences:\nAccording to CNN, the former FBI director and his team of crack investigators were caught somewhat flat-footed by the recent email revelations. They were believed to have been focusing their attention on former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn, son-in-law Jared Kushner and former campaign chair Paul Manafort, among others.\nAs it turns out, the first bit of concrete public evidence that someone in the president's inner circle might be open to Russian assistance in the presidential election involved Mr Trump's eldest son.\nThe president, Trump Jr and his administration have quickly reformed their defences and are now dismissing the meeting with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya last June as a minor event during a hurly-burly political season, largely lost in the fog of time, that led to nothing and which they have been admirably \"transparent\" in discussing.\nKey members of Congress seem to think otherwise, with senators like Republican Susan Collins of Maine calling for Trump Jr to be questioned by the Senate Intelligence Committee, and Republican Chuck Grassley of Iowa eager to bring Manafort before his Senate Judiciary Committee.\nBut while Congress gears up for more hearings, Mr Mueller operates quietly behind the scenes. Where might he look first? What threads, revealed in Trump Jr's emails, will he and his team tug on, to see what unravels?\nHere are a few of the tempting questions he might be tempted to ask.\nNestled toward the end of music publicist Goldstone's explosive first email to Trump Jr about the \"official documents and information\" the Russian government supposedly had about Hillary Clinton was that this constituted just \"part of\" Russia's support for his father, \"helped along by Aras and Emin\" Agalarov, the father-son Moscow-based real estate duo.\nIt's a rather stunning detail for Goldstone to have offhandedly mentioned - and one that Trump Jr, in his \"love it\" response, seems to have breezed past with no comment.\nThat kind of remark, however, would cause anyone looking for evidence of a Trump-Russia campaign collusion to stop dead in their tracks and ask: \"What's the rest of the story?\"\nWhy is this British guy emailing Trump Jr?\nEven if one takes Veselnitskaya at her word that she is not an agent of the Russian government and did not know or provide any damaging information about Mrs Clinton to the Trump team during the 9 June meeting, her own recent admissions raise some pressing questions.\nOn Tuesday she told an NBC interviewer that Trump Jr, Manafort and Kushner may have been \"longing for\" the dirt on their Democratic opponent.\n\"They wanted it so badly that they could only hear the thought that they wanted,\" she said.\nIn other words, Veselnitskaya walked out of that meeting in New York with the belief that Mr Trump's campaign both was desperately seeking damaging information about Mrs Clinton and were open to talking to Russian nationals about what they might have to offer.\nGiven that Veselnitskaya is at the very least a well-connected figure in Moscow, it doesn't require a great leap of faith to think this information eventually made its way to the Russian government. If the US intelligence community is to be believed, that government soon would acquire a trove of damaging information about Mrs Clinton and the Democrats as a result of hacks it co-ordinated into the Democratic National Committee server and the personal email of a senior member of Mrs Clinton's campaign team.\nIn the ensuing months, details from those hacks would be made public via Wikileaks at times that were particularly damaging to Mrs Clinton.\nDerogatory statements about Mrs Clinton's Democratic opponent Bernie Sanders were produced the week before Democrats gathered for their national convention. Transcripts of Mrs Clinton's paid speeches to Goldman Sachs were published just days before the final presidential debate - and cited during that showdown by Mr Trump himself.\nThe Trump campaign wanted dirt on Mrs Clinton. The Russian government had it in spades. Mr Mueller might want to see if those dots can be connected.\nAnother choice tidbit in that first Goldstone email was his suggestion that he might \"send this info to your father via Rhona\" - a reference to Rhona Graff, the elder Trump's personal assistant.\nGraff has served as the gatekeeper to Mr Trump at the Trump organisation - and, according to a profile in Politico, still is the preferred method for the president's business associates to contact him outside of White House channels.\n\"If I really wanted to whisper something in his ear, I would probably go to Rhona,\" Trump business associate John Catsimatidis told the publication.\nThe White House has said that Mr Trump did not know about the meeting with Veselnitskaya - despite the fact that his son, son-in-law and campaign chief were in attendance and it took place in his New York tower.\nIf this assertion is proven to be inaccurate, Rhona could be the key.\nTrump Jr meeting scandal: The key players\nThe middle portion of the email chain released on Tuesday morning involved Trump Jr and Goldstone trying to set up a phone conversation with Russian pop star/businessman Emin Agalarov.\nAfter a fair bit of wrangling the two apparently spoke, and the very next email was Goldstone informing Trump Jr he was scheduling the meeting with the \"Russian government attorney\" (Veselnitskaya) for later in the week.\nMr Mueller and congressional investigators may be interested in learning what Agalarov said that convinced Mr Trump to move ahead with the plans for a face-to-face gathering.\nAnd what was the nature of the relationship between Agalarov and the Trump clan, in light of Goldstone's observation that Emin and his father were helping Russia's support of the Trump campaign?\nDid Donald Trump Jr break the law?\nFour days after the first email from Goldstone to Trump Jr about the incriminating information the Russia government was said to have about Mrs Clinton, candidate Trump promised to give a \"major speech\" the following week discussing \"all of the things that have taken place with the Clintons\", including Mrs Clinton's alleged misdeeds while serving as secretary of state.\n\"I think you're going to find it very informative and very, very interesting,\" he added.\nThat speech, originally announced for the Monday after the Trump camp's New York meeting with Veselnitskaya, never took place.\nWas this an indication that the elder Trump may have known about the meeting - which, according to Trump Jr, did not produce the promised dirt on Mrs Clinton?\nThat's one more question Mr Mueller might be mulling.\nFollow Anthony Zurcher on Twitter.",

Goldstone's email also mentioned that Emin Agalarov and his father, a Moscow-based real estate duo, had helped Russia's support for Trump.

They are taken seriously.\nRumours of a paedophile ring in Wrexham were nothing new. They had been circulating for years.\nIn 2000, the Waterhouse inquiry into physical and sexual abuse in north Wales children's homes acknowledged its existence.\n\"Twenty-five years ago, when I was first involved in digging this up, there was almost like a wall of silence,\" said Malcolm King, a Wrexham councillor who has been instrumental in exposing abuse of children in care.\n\"There was almost a disbelief that this sort of evil could be going on in our midst without us ever knowing about it.\"\n\"So breaking that dam of disbelief has been one of the important things that has happened over the past quarter of a century.\n\"But there's still much more to be done because the evidence is that there are hundreds and hundreds of people who've been abused that have never come forward, often abuse within their own families.\n\"But nevertheless, people remain silent with the most terrible things having been done to them.\"\nMr King and officers on the National Crime Agency's Operation Pallial team - set up in 2012 after Home Secretary Theresa May ordered an investigation into claims of previously overlooked child abuse in north Wales - have repeatedly paid tribute to the five victims.\nThe stress of facing their nightmare past, raking up excruciating memories and of being branded liars by the very men who brutalised them, can only be imagined.\n\"There is no forensic evidence - it's far too late for that,\" explains Mr Beltrami.\n\"No phone evidence, no CCTV, the usual supporting evidence is not available in a case of this nature so it comes down in the end to the oral testimony of the witnesses and of course the defendants have their say and it's for the jury to make up their mind whether they can be sure on the evidence they hear.\"\nThe victims told the jury how they had been abused mostly at the home of Gary Cooke - also known as Mark Grainger - who has a string of sex convictions.\nAt the time, he worked as a professional wrestler and ran a sex shop. He was also the ringleader of the gang of paedophiles.\nHe had taken in two lodgers - Neil Phoenix and local radio personality Roy Norry - who exploited his local celebrity status to ensnare his victims.\nTogether with civil servant Edward Huxley, they met former singer David Lightfoot who ran a bar in the town centre called Snowy's.\nHere, the gang also gathered young boys to abuse.\nThe grooming tactics adopted by the abusers have been described as \"carefully planned and single minded\" and continued over their victims' childhoods.\n\"They were clearly vulnerable young people,\" said Ian Mulcahey, senior investigating officer with the National Crime Agency.\n\"They were targeted because of that reason. They were taken into this network of people and it's been difficult to escape that cycle.\"\nVerdicts\nHe added: \"They accessed their victims in a variety of ways. Some by chance meeting, then they've groomed them and  built up levels of trust.\n\"They've plied them with alcohol, they've given them attention. These were very vulnerable young boys. They've played on that vulnerability.\"\nThe men took them on car trips, provided pornography, drugs, drink and sometimes money. Some of the boys would then introduce their friends to the men.\n\"I think the victims are incredibly brave,\" Mr Beltrami added.\n\"They have suffered over a very long period of time.\n\"It's not easy to come along and give evidence of sexual offences that have been committed against you in your childhood, particularly going through the criminal process with someone else coming along with suggestions that you're making it up. That's a hard process.\"\n\"Whilst the criminal justice process cannot put right the wrongs committed by these individuals, we hope that the victims will take some solace in knowing that their abusers have been brought to justice.\"\nSo the latest chapter in the scandal of child abuse in north Wales, both inside and outside the care system in the 70s and 80s, comes to a close.\nConnections with some of these men can be made with other known paedophiles.\nCooke once worked for notorious paedophile John Allen, who ran children's homes in north Wales and was jailed for life in 2014.\nThere is evidence that they preyed on the same victims.\nAs talk of conspiracies and establishment cover-ups continue, and as Operation Pallial presses on with its quest to expose historical child abuse in the region - it is fair to say this is unlikely to be the last we hear of this episode of north Wales's dark and shameful past.",

It wasn't just a slap in the face, it was a kick to the solar plexus and a proper shoeing in the aftermath.\nA record hiding. A shellacking to end all shellackings. Swing Low Sweet Chariot rung out around Twickenham in the last minutes, a hymn to a thunderously impressive team as they laid siege to the Scottish line in pursuit of an even bigger victory over Scotland than the one they  had - which was already the biggest of all time.\nThey got over for their seventh try with the last play and they deserved it. Sixty-one points. For the Scots, it was a form of sporting torture.\nThe surreal thing is that Scotland's unrelenting Kafkaesque nightmare began after just two minutes when Fraser Brown was put in the bin. While he was there, the game was won and lost. Just like that.\nEnglish power, English pace, English points. Lots and lots of them. Eddie Jones did his stuff. In this Six Nations there hasn't been much, if any, evidence of frailties in the Scotland midfield but Jones saw some and, Lord, how England executed.\nThey threw a dummy runner at Alex Dunbar and Huw Jones, a little bit of deception that created a very large hole and the opening try for Jonathan Joseph. Scotland were spooked now. The might of Twickenham closed in on them. Stuart Hogg dropped a high ball and a minute later it was 10-0. Brown came back on to the field, overthrew his first line-out and suddenly it was 13-0.\nThen it all got weird as well as woeful. Hogg disappeared for a head injury assessment and wasn't seen again - another colossal blow to Scotland's morale.\nMark Bennett came on, got injured after a few minutes and then went off again. Tommy Seymour was now playing full-back, Ali Price was on the right wing, Henry Pyrgos was scrum-half. Deckchairs. Rearranged. Titanic.\nJoseph raced through the Scottish midfield for a second one-phase try after 25 minutes and in that moment a giant jumbo jet appeared in the skies above Twickenham. Metaphorically, the visiting fans were on it. In body they were still there cheering their team. In mind, they were out of there.\nGordon Reid's try wasn't so much of a sign of a comeback as a consolation. After half an hour. And even when the prop blasted over, and Russell converted, Scotland's death-wish kicked in again.\nMore Scottish indiscipline gave Farrell another shot at goal and the centre knocked over his kick. At 23-7 the Scots were on the canvas. The misery was in seeing them having to get up only to get knocked down again.\nTwo minutes after Farrell's penalty, Joseph plunged the knife deeper, exposing the midfield defence and teeing-up Anthony Watson. That was just before half-time. Just after, Joseph got his hat-trick. A third single-phase score, a continuation of the catastrophe.\nEngland were an angry and focused team. All the chat about their slow starts to games was dynamited to kingdom come, all the talk about them having not played particularly well in this Six Nations was consigned to the rubbish bin. This was a mighty response. A vicious deconstruction of Scotland's momentum.\nAnother injury hit them early in the second half. Of course it did. Seymour went off, Duncan Weir came on and he became Scotland's third full-back of the day. Soon after, Farrell's boot brought up the 40 for England.\nGod help them, but Scotland did their best to fight the inevitable. They tried to play, tried to avoid the concession of the kind of Twickenham points mountain that would have broken records. Jones scored, but England stirred again and Billy Vunipola replied. Jones scored again and like a cat with a mouse England responded, Danny Care bringing up the half-century that put this victory into the history books.\nSix tries and it could have been seven had it not been for a Jones try-saver on Watson. Scotland wanted the whistle now - they wanted it from midway through the first half if truth be told - but they didn't hear it.\nThey were out on their feet, the English substitutes coming on and turning the screw, piling on the grief like the best teams do. No let-up, no throttling down on the power. This is how champions behave - and England are fine, fine champions.\nThey went for their seventh try and their 60th point as if they needed it like they needed their last breath. They camped themselves on the Scottish line, put them through scrum upon scrum, defence upon defence. For the weary visitors, it was torture. Physical and mental.\nCare got that seventh score to complete the jaw-dropping rout. Nobody could see this coming. Nobody. Scotland came here in search of a dream. In the end, it was their worst kind of nightmare.",

Ouch.\nIt was a sharp reminder that we're about to enter an election campaign.\nAnd it was also clear that economic development will play a big part in Labour's campaign, with Aston Martin not only being mentioned twice but a claim that there'll be more jobs announcements in the coming weeks.\nCarwyn Jones then attacked Plaid, claiming their policies usually involve the creation of a \"national committee of some kind\".\nNow that the sentimental spell had been broken, Kirsty Williams followed in kind by criticising Labour's record on access to GPs, child poverty and education standards.\nMuch of it was standard pre-election fare but there was an interesting tone from Carwyn Jones on proposals for the M4 relief road.\nHe said: \"We wish to see the M4 relief road being built.

Instead they made a commitment to have diggers in the ground within a year.\nWhat's fascinating about the M4 relief road is that it stands in stark contrast to the metro rail scheme, which will form part of the new Cardiff city deal.\nThe metro, to improve bus and train services in south east Wales, is supported by virtually everyone while the M4 relief road is one of the most divisive subjects in Welsh politics.",

But so far, these extrasolar satellites have lingered at the limits of detection with current techniques.\nDr David Kipping, assistant professor of astronomy at Columbia University in New York, says he has spent \"most of his adult life\" looking for exomoons.\nFor the time being, however, he urged caution, saying: \"We would merely describe it at this point as something consistent with a moon, but, who knows, it could be something else.\"\nThe Kepler telescope hunts for planets by looking for tiny dips in the brightness of a star when a planet crosses in front - known as a transit. To search for exomoons, researchers are looking for a dimming of starlight before and after the planet causes its dip in light.\nThe promising signal was observed during three transits - fewer than the astronomers would like to have in order to confidently announce a discovery.\nThe work by Dr Kipping, his Columbia colleague Alex Teachey and citizen scientist Allan R Schmitt, assigns a confidence level of four sigma to the signal from the distant planetary system. The confidence level describes how unlikely it is that an experimental result is simply down to chance. If you express it in terms of tossing a coin, it's equivalent to tossing 15 heads in row.\nBut Dr Kipping said this is not the best way to gauge the potential detection.\nHe told BBC News: \"We're excited about it... statistically, formally, it's a very high probability. But do we really trust the statistics? That's something unquantifiable. Until we get the measurements from Hubble, it may as well be 50-50 in my mind.\"\nThe candidate moon is known as Kepler-1625b I and is observed around a star that lies some 4,000 light-years from Earth. On account of its large size, team members have dubbed it a \"Nept-moon\".\nA current theory of planetary formation suggests such an object is unlikely to have formed in place with its Jupiter-mass planet, but would instead be an object captured by the gravity of the planet later on in the evolution of this planetary system.\nThe researchers could find no predictions of a Neptune-sized moon in the literature, but Dr Kipping notes that nothing in physics prevents one.\nA handful of possible candidates have come to light in the past, but none as yet has been confirmed.\n\"I'd say it's the best [candidate] we've had,\" Dr Kipping told me.\n\"Almost every time we hit a candidate, and it passes our tests, we invent more tests until it finally dies - until it fails one of the tests... in this case we've applied everything we've ever done and it's passed all of those tests. On the other hand, we only have three events.\"\nThe work by Dr Kipping and colleagues forms part of the Hunt for Exomooons with Kepler (HEK) collaboration.\nFollow Paul on Twitter.",
        "output": "Astronomers have detected a signal that could be an exomoon, a moon orbiting a planet outside our solar system. The signal was detected by Nasa's Kepler Space Telescope, and the team plans to carry out follow-up observations with the Hubble Space Telescope in October. The candidate moon, known as Kepler-1625b I, is estimated to be about the size and mass of Neptune and orbits a Jupiter-sized planet with 10 times the mass. The team has assigned a confidence level of four sigma to the signal, but Dr. David Kipping, who led the study, urged caution and said, \"We would merely describe it at this point as something consistent with a moon, but, who knows, it could be something else.\" The researchers found no predictions of a Neptune-sized moon in the literature, but Dr. Kipping notes that nothing in physics prevents one.",
